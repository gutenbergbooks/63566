<h3>
CHAPTER I.
<br /><br />
WHY I WENT TO SEA.
</h3>

<p>
It was the evening of the sixteenth of March.
</p>

<p>
Exactly six months had elapsed since I left my
father's snug villa at Peckham, with its walls
shrouded by roses and honeysuckle; and now I
found myself two thousand three hundred miles
distant from it, in his agent's counting-room, in the
dreary little town of St. John, in Newfoundland,
writing in a huge ledger, and blowing my fingers
from time to time, for snow more than ten feet
deep covered all the desolate country, and the
shipping in the harbour was imbedded in ice at
least three feet in thickness; while the thermometer,
at which I glanced pretty often, informed me that
the mercury had sunk twelve degrees below the
freezing point.
</p>

<p>
While busily engrossing quintals of salted fish,
by the thousand, barrels of Hamburg meal and
Irish pork, chests of bohea, bales of shingles,
kegs of gunpowder, caplin nets, anchors and
cables, and Indian corn from the United States,
with all the heterogeneous mass of everything
which usually fill the stores of a wealthy merchant
in that terra nova, I thought of the noisy world
of London, from which I had been banished, or, as
tutors and guardians phrased it, "sent to learn
something of my father's business&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, practically
to begin life as he had begun it;" and so I sighed
impatiently over my monotonous task, while melting
the congealed ink, from time to time, on the
birchwood fire, and reverting to what March is in
England, where we may watch the bursting of the
new buds and early flowers; where the birds are
heard in every sprouting hedge and tree, and as we
inhale the fresh breeze of the morning, a new and
unknown delight makes our pulses quicken and
a glow of tenderness fill the heart&mdash;for then we
see and feel, as some one says, "what we have seen
and felt <i>only</i> in <i>childhood and spring</i>."
</p>

<p>
"Belay this scribbling business, Jack," said a
hearty voice in my ear; "come, ship on board my
brig, and have a cruise with me in the North Sea.
I shall have all my hands aboard to-morrow."
</p>

<p>
I looked up, threw away my pen, closed the
gigantic ledger with a significant bang, and shook
the hand of the speaker, who was my old friend and
schoolfellow, Bob Hartly, whose face was as red as
the keen frost of an American winter evening could
make it, albeit he was buttoned to the throat in a
thick, rough Flushing coat, and wore a cap with
fur ear-covers tied under his chin&mdash;a monk-like
hood much worn in these northern regions during
the season of snow.
</p>

<p>
"I don't think your cruise after seals and blubber
will be a very lively affair, Bob," said I, rubbing my
hands at the stove, on which he was knocking the
ashes of his long Havannah.
</p>

<p>
"Lively! if it is not more lively than this
quill-driving work, may I never see London Bridge again,
or take,
</p>

<p class="poem">
  'Instead of pistol or a dagger, a<br />
  Desperate leap down the falls of Niagara!'"<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"I am sick of this Cimmerian region!" said I,
stamping with vexation at his jocular mood, when
contrasted to my own surly one.
</p>

<p>
"Cimmerian&mdash;ugh! that phrase reminds me of
school-times, and how we used to blunder through
Homer together, for he drew all his images of Pluto
and Pandemonium from the dismal country of the
Cimmerii.  By Jove!  I could give you a stave yet
from Virgil or Ovid, hand over hand, on the same
subject; but that would be paying Her Majesty's
colony a poor compliment."
</p>

<p>
"Well, Bob, I am sick of this place, in which
evil fate, or rather bad luck, has buried me alive&mdash;this
frozen little town of wood and tar, without outlet
by sea or land in winter, without amusement, and,
at this time, seemingly without life."
</p>

<p>
"It forms a contrast to London, certainly," said
Hartly, assisting himself, uninvited, to the contents
of a case-bottle of Hollands which stood near;
"but there is a mint of money to be made in
it."
</p>

<p>
"The first English folks who came here were reduced
to such straits, we are told, that they killed
and ate each other; and those who returned were
such skeletons that their wives and mothers did not
know them."
</p>

<p>
Hartly laughed loudly, and said&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"But that was in the time of King Henry VIII.,
and people don't eat each other here now.  But to
resume what we were talking about&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Old Uriah Skrew, my father's agent, and I are
on the worst terms; he keeps a constant watch over
me.  I go from my desk to bed, and from bed to my
desk&mdash;so passes my existence."
</p>

<p>
"Why not slip your cable and run, then?"
</p>

<p>
"Skrew being a partner in the firm," I continued,
warming at the idea of my own rights and fancied
wrongs, "cares for nothing but making money from
the riches of the sea, and thinks only of cargoes of
fish to be bartered in Lent, at Cadiz, for fruit and
wine, oil, seals, and blubber; and really in this
cold season&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Ah, but summer is coming," interrupted Bob,
drily.
</p>

<p>
"Summer!  How is the year divided here?"
</p>

<p>
"Into nine months of winter and three of bad
weather."
</p>

<p>
"A pleasant prospect!  If I were once again at
Peckham&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Well, Jack, I have a grudge at old Uriah Skrew,
for, like a swab, he played me a scurvy trick about a
cargo I had consigned to your father and him, from
Cadiz, last year&mdash;a trick by which I lost all my
profit and tonnage.
</p>

<p>
"Likely enough; this ledger is Uriah's bible&mdash;and
his God&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Is gold!  So I care not a jot if, for the mere sake
of provoking him, I lend you a hand to give him
the slip, for a few months at least.  Ship with me
to-morrow&mdash;as a volunteer, passenger, or whatever
you please."
</p>

<p>
"I shall," said I, throwing my pen resolutely
into the fire.
</p>

<p>
"Your hand on it!  I like this.  Get your
warmest toggery sent on board; you'll need it all,
I can tell you!  I can give you a long gun, and bag
for powder and slugs; and then, with a bowie-knife
in your belt, a seal-skin cap with long flaps, and a
stout pea-jacket, you will make as smart a seal
fisher as ever sailed through the Narrows!  By this
time to-morrow you may be forty miles from your
ledger, running through the North Sea with a
flowing sheet.  By Jove, I know a jolly old Esquimau
who lives at Cape Desolation under an old
whaleboat.  He will be delighted to make your
acquaintance, and give you a feed of sea weed and
blubber that will make your mouth water, though
we eat it when the mercury is frozen in the
bulb."
</p>

<p>
This cheerful prospect of Arctic hospitality might
have persuaded me to remain where I was, but
soured by the treatment I experienced from
Mr. Skrew, who misrepresented my conduct and habits
to my family at home, and tired of the monotony
of his counting-room, I looked forward with
eagerness to an anticipated escape.
</p>

<p>
How little could I foresee the consequences of my
impatience, folly, and wayward desire for rambling!
Ere a month was past, I had repented in bitterness
my boyish repugnance for steady application and
industrious habits.
</p>

<p>
My friend, Robert Hartly, who was eight years
my senior, was master and owner of the <i>Leda</i>, a
smart brig of two hundred and fifty tons register&mdash;a
craft in which he had invested all his savings.
Last year he had lost a wife and two children,
whom he tenderly loved; he had come to St. John
from Cadiz, missed a freight and been frozen-in,
and now, with all a sailor's restlessness and dread of
being idle, even for a month or two, he had resolved
to sail for the spring seal fishery, as a change of
scene, and a trip which he hoped would not prove
unprofitable, as his vessel was one of a class far
superior to those which usually venture into the
region of ice, being well found, well manned,
coppered to the bends, and, in short, the perfection
of a British merchant brig.
</p>

<p>
"By the bye," said he, "talking of powder and
slugs, we may need both, for other purposes than
shooting seals."
</p>

<p>
"How?" I asked.
</p>

<p>
"I mean if we came athwart the <i>Black Schooner</i>
which has been prowling and plundering about the
coast for the last six weeks."
</p>

<p>
"Are there more news of her?"
</p>

<p>
"No; but here is a placard given to all
shipmasters yesterday," said he, unfolding a paper
surmounted by the royal arms, and running in the
name of "His Excellency the Governor and
Commander-in-Chief over the Island of Newfoundland
and its Dependencies," offering 500<i>1.</i> to the crew of
any ship that would capture "the vessel known as
the <i>Black Schooner</i>," &amp;c.  "She is a queer craft,"
continued Hartly, "and said to be a slaver,
bankrupt, and out of business; though Paul Reeves,
my mate, maintains that she is the <i>Adventure</i> galley.
which sailed from London in the time of King
William III., and that her crew are the ghosts of
Kidd and his pirates; but ghosts don't steal beef
and drink brandy."
</p>

<p>
Hartly's father had been in the navy; thus he
had received a good and thorough nautical education,
but early in life had been left to work his
way in the world; so he made the watery portion
thereof his home and means of livelihood.  He
was a handsome, hardy, and cheerful young
fellow, and the <i>beau idéal</i> of a thorough British
seaman.
</p>

<p>
On the third finger of his left hand he wore a
curious ring of base metal, graven with runes of
strange figures.  This was the gift of an old woman
to whom he had rendered some service when in
Iceland, and who had promised, that while he wore
it, he could <i>never be drowned</i>; consequently Hartly
was too much imbued with the superstition of his
profession to part with it for a moment.
</p>

<p>
"But how am I to elude old Skrew, and get on
board," said I, after we had concluded all our
arrangements, over a glass of hot brandy-punch, in
Bob's lodgings in Water-street.
</p>

<p>
"True&mdash;the brig lies frozen-in at the end of his
wharf, the hatches are all locked, and the hands
ashore."
</p>

<p>
"If he sees me on board, there will be an end of
our project, for I have no wish to quarrel with him
in an unseemly manner; but merely to 'levant'
quietly, leaving a letter to announce where I am
gone, and when I may, perhaps, return."
</p>

<p>
"All right&mdash;I have it!  I'll send an empty cask
to Skrew's store to-morrow.  Paul Reeves, the mate,
and Hammer, the carpenter, will head you up in it,
and so you may be brought on board unknown to
all save them&mdash;ay, under the very nose of old
Uriah.  Will that suit you?"
</p>

<p>
"Delightfully!" said I, clapping my hands.  The
whole affair had the appearance of an adventure,
and though there were a hundred ways by which I
might have joined the brig, when the <i>cutting-out</i> of
the sealing fleet took place next day, like a young
schoolboy&mdash;for in some respects I was little more&mdash;I
accepted the strange proposal of going on board
in a cask, and retired to bed, to dream of adventures
on the high seas; for being young, healthy, and
active, I could always have pleasant dreams without
studying the art of procuring them&mdash;an art on
which Dr. Franklin wrote so learnedly in the last
century.

<h3>
CHAPTER II.
<br /><br />
ADVENTURE IN A CASK.
</h3>

<p>
On the next day (17th of March), when the fleet
of adventurers departs for the spring seal fishery,
the little seaport town of St. John's presents
an unusual aspect of bustle and gaiety.  On that
anniversary, at least one hundred vessels, having
on board three thousand seamen, batmen, and
gunners, sail to seek their fortune in the
ice-fields; but on the day I am about to describe,
the number of craft and their crews far exceeded
this.
</p>

<p>
The day was clear and sunny, not a speck of cloud
was in the sky, whose immensity of blue made the
eye almost ache, while the intense brilliance of the
snow, which covered the hills and the whole scenery,
made them seem to vibrate in the sunshine, and
caused a species of blindness, especially on entering
any apartment, however large or well-lighted; for
after being out of doors in that season and region for
an hour or so, a house usually seems totally dark for
a time.
</p>

<p>
For some days previous there had been that species
of drizzle which is termed locally "a silver thaw,"
thus, all the houses of the town, the roofs, walls,
and chimneys; the trees, the shipping in the frozen
harbour, every mast, yard, and inch of standing or
running rigging, were thickly coated with clear ice,
which sparkled like prisms in the sunshine, making
them seem as if formed of transparent crystal.  Then,
there was a glittering in the frosty atmosphere, as if
it was composed of minute particles, while the
intensity of the cold made one feel as if a coarse file
were being roughly applied to one's nose or cheekbones
on facing the west, the point whence the wind
came over the vast and snow-covered tracts of
untrodden and unexplored country which stretch
away for three hundred miles towards the Red
Indian Lake and the Bay of Exploits.
</p>

<p>
The keepers of stores and shops&mdash;who in St. John
are usually dressed like seamen, in round jackets and
glazed hats&mdash;with all idlers, were pouring through
every avenue and thoroughfare, and spreading over
the harbour.  All the ships displayed their colours,
and the sound of music, as bands perambulated the
ice, rang upon the clear and ambient air, mingled
with the musical jingle of the sleigh bells, as the
more wealthy folks, muffled and shawled to the nose,
galloped their horses with arrow-like speed from side
to side of the harbour.
</p>

<p>
The latter and the town (but especially the
grog-shops) were crowded by the seal fishermen, who
had come in from all parts of the coast, and bore
bundles of clothing slung over their backs, each
having his carefully selected club wherewith to
smite the young seals on the head, and also to be
used as a gaff or ice-hook.  Many of these men
were also armed with long sealing-guns, which are
twice the size and weight of an ordinary musket,
and resemble the huge, unwieldy gingals of the
East Indians, having flintlocks of a clumsy fashion.
</p>

<p>
They are generally loaded with coarse-grained
powder and pieces of lead, termed <i>slugs</i>, to shoot
the old seals, who frequently prove refractory, and
dangerous when defending their young.
</p>

<p>
Those fishers who are thus armed as gunners
rank before the mere clubmen, and receive a small
remuneration, or are remitted some of the "berth
money" which is usually paid to the storekeeper or
merchant who equips the vessel for the ice; "the
outfitting," says one who is well-informed on these
matters, "being always defrayed by the receipt of
one-half the cargo of seals, the other half going to
adventurers, with these and other deductions for
extra supplies."  But, as Captain Hartly fitted out
his own vessel and shipped his own crew, gunners,
and batmen at stipulated salaries, he expected to
reap the whole profits of the expedition.
</p>

<p>
In addition to the project I had in view, I was
particularly anxious to witness the gaiety of this the
only and yearly colonial gala day&mdash;the shipping of
the crews, (who always proceed in procession along
the ice,) with the cutting-out and departure of
the sealers; but old Mr. Uriah Skrew, with his
clean-shaven face and small cunning eyes, was in
the counting-room betimes, and piled work upon
me thick and fast, to anticipate any application for
a day's leave.
</p>

<p>
"May I not go out for an hour, sir, and see what
is going on in the harbour?" I asked, gently.
</p>

<p>
"No, sir," he replied, sharply; "such nonsense
only leads to idleness&mdash;idleness to dissipation, and
dissipation to ruin!  That is the sliding-scale,
young man&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Oh! my good sir, you are too severe."
</p>

<p>
"Severe!  Mr. Jack Manly!&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Well, sir?"
</p>

<p>
"I have always been kind and indulgent to you."
</p>

<p>
"Kind&mdash;hum."
</p>

<p>
"Yes; more kind and indulgent than your father,
my worthy partner, wishes&mdash;and more than he
would be."
</p>

<p>
"Query?"
</p>

<p>
"What do you mean by 'query'?" he demanded in
a bullying tone, for he intensely disliked me, fearing
that I should soon be admitted into the firm.
</p>

<p>
"Because I have my doubts on the subject, and
your refusal to grant me leave to-day confirms my
opinion of you, Mr. Skrew."
</p>

<p>
"Very well; enough of this, not a word more, or
by the first ship for Europe I will write what you'll
wish had not been written.  Not a word more."
</p>

<p>
"I am mute as a fish."
</p>

<p>
"Engross these papers&mdash;but, first, go to the store
on the wharf, and tell the keeper to speak with me;
and look sharp!"
</p>

<p>
I put on my cap and left the counting-room,
feeling assured that many a day would elapse ere I
stood within it again, as I caught a glimpse of Paul
Reeves, mate of the <i>Leda</i>, and two seamen, loitering
outside; but near the window, wherein stood my
desk, under the leaf of which I deposited a letter
addressed to Mr. Skrew, informing him, in the parlance
of Bob Hartly, that "I had slipped my cable and
gone to sea."
</p>

<p>
"Captain Hartly's friend, sir?" said the mate,
touching his hat, and winking knowingly.
</p>

<p>
"Yes."
</p>

<p>
"All right, sir! here is the cask, step in, and
Tom Hammer, our carpenter, and his mate, will
head you up in it comfortably in less than a
minute."
</p>

<p>
"No one is near?" said I, anxiously glancing
round the courtyard.
</p>

<p>
"Not a soul, sir: in you go, on with the head,
Tom, and be quick, for the ice channel is cutting
fast to the fairway; the jib and foretopsail are
loose, and the lashings all but cast off."
</p>

<p>
The counting-room of Messrs. Manly and Skrew
stood within a courtyard, which was entered by a
gateway from Water-street; and from this court&mdash;which
was formed by four large wooden stores, all
pitched, tarred, and now coated with snow and ice&mdash;a
path led down to the wharf, at the end of which,
as at the end of all the others that jutted into
the harbour, a mercantile flag was displayed from
a mast.  In this court were piles of old barrels,
hampers, boxes, an anchor, a spare topmast or so,
half buried under the usual white mantle, on which
a flock of poor little snowbirds were hopping and
twittering drearily.
</p>

<p>
"Do you feel snug, sir?" inquired Paul Reeves,
through the bunghole.
</p>

<p>
"Yes; but please to lose no time in getting me
through the crowd on the wharf, and on board the
<i>Leda</i>" I replied, in a somewhat imploring tone of
voice; for the cask, though a roomy one, was the
reverse of comfortable, and already I longed to
stretch myself.
</p>

<p>
"The <i>Leda</i> lies just outside the Bristol clipper."
</p>

<p>
"She that was overhauled and plundered,
and had three of her crew shot by the <i>Black
Schooner</i>?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sir," replied Reeves, as the two seamen
hoisted up the cask; and I soon became aware by the
clamour around me that I was being conveyed down
to the wharf, where Mr. Skrew, in a full suit of
Petersham and sables, was walking to and fro till his
sledge arrived.
</p>

<p>
"Hallo, what have you fellows got in the cask?"
he demanded as I was borne past him.
</p>

<p>
"Some of the captain's stores, sir," replied
Reeves.
</p>

<p>
"His grandmother's best featherbed," added the
carpenter.
</p>

<p>
"Very good," said Uriah, as I was deposited
almost on his gouty toes.
</p>

<p>
Men often stumbled against my cask, and swore
at it or pushed it aside.  Once a fellow seated himself
on it, and kicked with his heels till I was nearly
deranged, and the impulse to scare him by a shout
became almost irrepressible.  For a time, I dreaded
that it might be tumbled off the wharf into the
sludge and broken ice alongside!
</p>

<p>
Ere long the wharf was cleared; I heard the
clanking of the gates, as the keeper, by order of
Mr. Skrew, locked them, doubtless to exclude me
therefrom on this great gala day; and then followed the
jangling of bells, as he stepped into his sledge, and
departed upon the ice.  Thus I was left to my own
reflections on the solitary wharf.
</p>

<p>
Before this, a great commotion had taken place
at the extremity thereof, as the Bristol clipper by
some mismanagement ran foul of the <i>Leda</i>, and
the usual volleys of threats, oaths, and orders
incident to such collisions in harbour were exchanged
from the decks and rigging of both vessels, while, by
using boat-hooks aloft and fenders below, the crew
strove to keep the rigging clear and the hulls apart.
</p>

<p>
Amid this unexpected hurly-burly, I was <i>forgotten</i>
in my cask!
</p>

<p>
The wharf stood near the western extremity of
the town, which lies along the basin of the harbour.
The sounds in my vicinity seemed all to die
away, as the crowd along the shore and upon the ice
followed the ships, which in succession were warped
along their ice-channels into the fairway, and each
was greeted by a tremendous cheer as the sails fell,
their head canvas filled, and they broke into blue
water; but hours seemed to elapse, without a person
coming near the horrible cask in which I was
imprisoned, and the agonies I endured are beyond
description!
</p>

<p>
The sense of oppression and of being cramped
amounted to intense bodily torture; thus a
perspiration alternately burning hot and icy cold burst
over me.  The interior of this now detested prison
seemed hot as a furnace; yet there was in my soul
a deadly fear of perishing by cold, as I should
assuredly do, if left all night on the locked wharf, in
such a climate, with the thermometer at twelve
degrees below the freezing point!
</p>

<p>
How fruitlessly I repented me of the silly project
of thus escaping, and alternately longed to be back
again in Skrew's snug counting-room, or on board the
departing brig&mdash;of being anywhere, instead of being
thus "cabin'd, cribb'd, confin'd," and forgotten.
A terror of being conveyed on board, and left,
perhaps, in the hold&mdash;left undiscovered till dead of
suffocation, gave me wild energy; madly I strove to
kick or beat out the head of the cask; but my legs
were powerless, as if suffering from paralysis, for
my aching knees were wedged under my chin, and
I might as well have attempted to escape from a
block of adamant.
</p>

<p>
Faintness and delirium were fast coming over me!
I screamed like a madman; but my hoarse voice
was lost in the hollow of the cask.  Though a
perspiration bathed all my aching limbs, my tongue
clove to my palate, and soon became hot and dry.
Starry lights seemed to flash and dance before me in
the darkness; my brain reeled; then I gasped, as
sense and pulsation ebbed together, and after
enduring three hours (as I afterwards learned) of such
agony as those who were confined in the stone
chests of the Venetians, or in the iron cages which
Louis XI. placed in the Bastille, alone could have
known&mdash;I fainted.

<h3>
CHAPTER III.
<br /><br />
THE NARROWS OF ST. JOHN.
</h3>

<p>
On recovering, I found myself in the cabin of the
<i>Leda</i>, with Captain Hartly hanging over me, and
chafing my hands and temples, in anxiety and
solicitude, with hartshorn and vinegar; for being a
kind-hearted fellow, he was seriously alarmed.
</p>

<p>
In these friendly offices he was ably assisted by
Cuffy Snowball, his black cook, who burned several
grey goose-quills under my nose, and who brought
me a rummer full of brandy-punch steaming hot
from the galley.  On swallowing this, which they
forced me to do at two draughts, I became
considerably revived and invigorated.
</p>

<p>
"Why did you leave me there, Hartly&mdash;it might
have been, to die?" I asked, reproachfully.
</p>

<p>
"I did not leave you, my dear boy, at least not a
moment longer than we could help," he replied.  "It
cost us no small trouble to get clear of that
lubberly barque.  I wish the <i>Black Schooner</i> had sunk
her, when athwart her hawse!  We had to clap on all
hands to warping into the fairway, and once there,
we had to keep constantly forging a-head, as other
craft were crowding into the channel astern of us."
</p>

<p>
"Then I was pretty near being left till the
wharf-keeper came next morning.  My heaven!  I should
have been stiff enough by that time!"
</p>

<p>
"I sent Paul Reeves and Hans Peterkin to bring
off the cask on a sledge, and you may imagine the
fright we were in on finding you cramped up and
lifeless as a pickled herring!"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Hartly," said I, "the torture I endured was
frightful!  I now repent of my undertaking, and wish
myself back again."
</p>

<p>
"Repent&mdash;bah!  It has been a stupidly managed
job, but it is over now, and there is an end of it.
Take another sip of the hot brandy-and-water, and
come on deck; we are abreast of the Crow's Nest now,
and in ten minutes more will be in blue water; then
hurrah for the ice-fields!"
</p>

<p>
I followed him on deck, and found that we were,
as he said, abreast of a high sugar-loaf shaped rock,
crowned by a little battery named the Crow's Nest,
and that around us a very exciting scene was passing.
</p>

<p>
The <i>Leda</i> was now in the fairway, or main
channel, which was formed through the ice in the centre
of the harbour, and into which there were cut more
than fifty canals, or connecting links, along which
the sealing ships were being warped from the various
wharves at which they had been fitted out.  All
were gaily decked with their owners' private colours,
and had their courses, or lower sails, cast loose, and
were accompanied by crowds, who were conversing,
laughing, and expressing their hopes of a successful
fishery to the crews, whose voices rang cheerily as
they tripped round the capstan or wrenched at the
windlass, till they came abreast of the kedge anchor
which was wedged in the ice; and then it was
torn up, and carried off a-head towards the Narrows.
when the cheering, warping, and tripping began
anew.
</p>

<p>
Thousands of persons, many of them on skates,
covered all the glassy expanse of the frozen harbour,
which from some points of view appears land-locked,
so closely do the mountains of rock converge at its
entrance; and hundreds of sledges (Mr. Uriah
Skrew's among the number), with round Russian
bells at their horses' collars, or on the circular iron
rod above their ears, with the drivers muffled in
furs, swept to and fro; while bands of music
playing the air invariable on this occasion,
"St. Patrick's Day," marched alongside of the departing
fleet.
</p>

<p>
Flags of every fashion&mdash;square, triangular, and
swallow-tailed&mdash;were streaming everywhere; on the
mastheads of the shipping, on the black-tarred
mercantile stores, and on the dwellings of their
owners&mdash;a passion for a display of bunting being one of
the peculiarities of this our most northern colony in
America.
</p>

<p>
The aspect of its capital, which covers the
northern slope of the harbour, is rather pretty,
though the country beyond is nearly as wild and as
dreary as when, in the words of Hakluyt&mdash;"in the
yeere of our Lord 1497, John Cabot a Venetian, and
his son Sebastian, with an English fleet from Bristol,
discovered that land which no man had before
attempted, on 24th June, about five of the clocke,
early in the morning.  That island which lieth out
before the land, he called of <i>St. John</i>, as I think,
because it was discovered upon the day of John the
Baptist."
</p>

<p>
During the brief summer, this harbour, the
entrance of which is so narrow that two ships can
scarcely pass in the dangerously deep mid-channel,
is smooth as a mill-pond, and presents a lively
scene, for there the smart Clyde-built clipper, the
dark and battered Sunderland collier brig, the
smart Yankee liner, with her gaudy stars and
stripes, her snowy decks, and gear so taut; the
Pomeranian, with her grass-green hull and
fur-capped crew; the Dutch galliot, all brown varnish,
and shaped like a half cheese, or like the old craft
that bore the Crusaders to Palestine; the huge ship
of Blackwall, redolent of guano, all blistered, rusted,
and turned yellow by the sun of the fiery south;
the sharp Spanish brig, which had run her cargo of
slaves in South Carolina and escaped here, to go
quietly home, with her brass nines hidden in the
hold, and with fish in Lent for the pious at Cadiz or
Oporto&mdash;during the brief season of summer, I say,
all these had been here; but now when a snowy
mantle covered the land, and black ice locked the
harbour, its basin or bosom presented a very
different scene.
</p>

<p>
Floundering through sludge and water, a thousand
of those men who are England's real pioneers in
the Far West&mdash;Irish emigrants&mdash;in long boots, were
cutting the thick ice with ponderous saws, and
pushing the blocks under the solid mass on either
side, to form a fairway or clear channel for the
shipping; and this channel, though at least
twenty feet broad, would certainly be frozen hard
and fast ere morning dawned.
</p>

<p>
On this occasion there passed out with us, as I
have elsewhere stated, more than one hundred sail
of sealing craft.  There were brigs, brigantines, and
schooners, ranging from fifty to two hundred and
fifty tons, all following each other through the
fairway, warping ahead, till beyond the Chain Rock,
where they got into open water.
</p>

<p>
Many of the smaller craft are miserably adapted
for the dangers they have to encounter, and thus
are frequently crushed or lost in the ice by being
swept off among the floes and fields to the far north,
from whence they never return.  Some, I have observed,
had only a box lined with fire-brick placed
on edge, lashed aft the foremast, for a caboose, and
an iron cauldron on three legs placed therein for
boiling the wretched mess of old salt pork and
doughballs which form the daily food of the crew,
who, with such apparatus, would be unable to cook
anything in foul weather or a heavy sea.
</p>

<p>
The wind was southerly for a time, but gradually
veered a little to the west as we neared the harbour
mouth.  After passing the Chain Rock, where a
cable of Cyclopean aspect, that now lies a mass of
rust thereon, was wont in times of war and alarm
to be stretched across to the Pancake Rock to
secure the harbour at night, we found ourselves in
the deep water.  With a loud cheer we brought the
kedge anchor and hawser on board.  Paul Reeves
took the wheel; we sheeted home the foresail and
gib, let fall the fore and main topsails, and brought
the starboard tacks on board when we were clear
of the Signal Hill, and the Dead Man's Bay&mdash;a
dreary inlet of the sea&mdash;lay on our quarter.
</p>

<p>
This hill is a stern and precipitous mountain of
sandstone and slate-rock, nearly six hundred feet in
height, with batteries that rise over each other in
tiers, to the highest, which is named "The
Queen's."  Opposite, towers an equally abrupt mountain of
similar height and aspect, having at its base a little
promontory defended by Fort Amherst.
</p>

<p>
The slender gut between is named the Narrows
of St. John.
</p>

<p>
The breeze came more and more round upon our
quarter as we ran past Signal Hill, ploughing through
a somewhat heavy surf; past the Sugar Loaf, and a
little creek where, in the clear summer sea, I have
seen the guns of an ancient and forgotten wreck
lying like black dots on the smooth white sand
many fathoms below; for in these regions, when a
brilliant sun shines upon the ocean, its waters become
transparent to a wondrous depth; thus giant corals,
dusky weeds, and the snow-white bones of mighty
fish,
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "With the rainbow hues of the sea-trees' bloom,"<br />
</p>

<p class="noindent">
may be seen distinctly at the depth of a hundred
and fifty feet from the surface.
</p>

<p>
There, too, I have seen the bright yellow sea
anemone, with its long fibrous leaves, that close
and shrink into the rocks from view when touched.
</p>

<p>
Cape St. Francis, one of the eastern promontories
of Avalon, was soon upon our beam; Cape Spear
light had sunk into the waves astern, and night was
coming down upon the wintry sea, when we hauled
up a point or two to the north and west, and stood
right away to the icy regions of the North; and
that night merrily at supper we sang in the cabin&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "'Twas in the year of 'sixty-one,<br />

<h3>
CHAPTER IV
<br /><br />
THE BRIG "LEDA."
</h3>

<p>
We had twenty-four hands on board; twelve of these
were landsmen, being gunners and batmen, half
agriculturists and half fishermen, who, at times, in
summer, left their families to till the scanty soil,
while they fished in open boats among the countless
creeks and bays which indent the peninsula of
Avalon; and now in winter, when all out-of-door
operations were suspended, and the land was buried
under fourteen feet of frozen snow&mdash;and when the
sea, even to the distance of two hundred miles, would
soon be bound with ice, they became seal-fishers;
and, like others, had shipped in the little fleet which,
on St. Patrick's Day, always departed from this
Iro-American isle for the stormy seas that lash the
Labrador.
</p>

<p>
All these men were Irish and oft at sea; I have
heard the poor fellows, when seated under the leech
of the foresail, with the icy spray flying over them
to leeward, singing the sweet or merry songs they had
learned at their mothers' knee, in the brave old land
they were fated never to see again&mdash;for the story of
our crew is a sad one!
</p>

<p>
We had a negro, who was our cook (of course),
Cuffy Snowball&mdash;I never heard him named otherwise;
and his adventures had been somewhat singular.
</p>

<p>
Cuffy had been a warrior of Congo, and dwelt in
a hut on the banks of the Zaire, where, by dint of
"his spear and shaggy shield," he had amassed a
wealth of baskets, gourds, carved calibashes, and
wooden spoons from cowards who could not defend
them.  He could tell, with great simplicity,
innumerable stories of his combats with other tribes,
and with lions, leopards, buffaloes, crocodiles, and
hippopotami; and in evidence of his prowess, he
wore on his left arm a bracelet formed entirely of
lions' teeth&mdash;which form a kind of "Order of
Valour" in Congo.  He had been very happy in his
wigwam, till the daughter of a Chenoo or chief&mdash;a
beautiful damsel, with her teeth painted blue and
the bone of a shark through her nose&mdash;espied him
one day, and desired to have him for her husband,
as it is the right of these ladies to do.
</p>

<p>
The chosen, of whom she becomes absolute mistress
and proprietress, dare not refuse, so poor Cuffy was
married to the Chenoo; there were great rejoicings,
and three prisoners of war were devoured at the
marriage-feast.
</p>

<p>
But his sable fair one tired of him in a short time,
and by certain artful means decoyed him one evening
to the mouth of the Zaire, and there sold him into
slavery.
</p>

<p>
The slave-ship was wrecked; but Cuffy got ashore
on the island of Jamaica, where he was very much
surprised to see some of his countrymen, dressed and
armed like white men, in coats of a red colour, with
light blue trousers; so he enlisted as a soldier in
one of her Majesty's West India Regiments.
</p>

<p>
Ere long Cuffy was made a corporal; and though
he ground his sharp teeth now and then when
thinking of his wigwam in Congo, and the treacherous
Chenoo his wife, he was very happy, for he had
plenty of rice, yams, and sangaree, and as a corporal,
carried his black snub nose very high indeed!
</p>

<p>
From Jamaica his company was ordered to
Trinidad, and the whole, a hundred in number, were
shipped on board of a Yankee barque which had
been freighted for the purpose.  Her skipper, on
seeing such a choice lot of tall and handsome young
negroes, proposed to their captain (a reckless fellow,
who was steeped to the lips in debt and all kinds of
West Indian dissipation) to bear away for the
Southern States of the Union, and there sell the
whole as slaves.  Singular as it may seem, the
captain, who owed more money in Trinidad than he
could ever hope to pay, accepted the proposal, and
the soldiers of this company of H.M. West India
Regiment, instead of garrisoning the isle where the
"mother of the cocoa" blooms, were duly landed at
Charleston in South Carolina, where they were all
sold to the highest bidders.  The skipper and
captain put the money in their pockets, leaving the
astonished lieutenant and ensign to get back to
headquarters in Jamaica as they best could.
</p>

<p>
Cuffy's new master proved a severe one, and under
his lash he often sighed for the rice, yams, and his
quiet duty as sentinel under a sunshade, or the high
authority he could wield as corporal over Scipio,
Sambo, or Julius Cæsar, in the days when he was
the white man's comrade; but one day Cuffy lost
his temper, and gave his master a tap on the head
with a sugar-hoe!
</p>

<p>
Then, without waiting to see whether or not he
had killed him, he fled into the woods&mdash;crossed the
Savannah river, and getting on board a British vessel
became a sailor, and within one year thereafter, was
shipped, as cook, on board the <i>Leda</i>.
</p>

<p>
The rest of our crew were all steady and hardy
men, and Paul Reeves, the senior mate, was the
model of an English sailor.
</p>

<p>
The wind had changed during the night; thus,
when next day dawned, we were still in sight of
Cape St. Francis&mdash;a snow-covered headland, which
shone white and drearily, as the sun came up from
the blue sea.
</p>

<p>
Hartly expressed some impatience at our progress
as we trod to and fro aft the mainmast in the clear,
cold, bracing air of the morning, while the odour
of a hot breakfast, which Cuffy was preparing, came
in whiffs from the galley.
</p>

<p>
"Never mind," said I; "the wind will soon
change again&mdash;I can see by the clouds there are
contrary currents overhead; and when once among
the ice, we shall have great fun!"
</p>

<p>
"Fun!  I don't know much about that," said
Hartly, who, like every seaman, was put in a sulky
mood by a foul wind.
</p>

<p>
"We shall have perils to encounter!"
</p>

<p>
"Perils may be fun to one so young as you,
Jack," said Hartly, pausing thoughtfully; "however,
in our trade, I have ever found that peril and
profit go together.  Think over all we have read
of what Parry, Ross, Scoresby, Franklin, and Kane
underwent in those regions of ice and snow; and I
do not remember the word <i>fun</i> occurring once in
their narratives."
</p>

<p>
"Well," said I, abashed by his monitory tone,
"we shall have excitement, at all events."
</p>

<p>
"Both excitement and danger, I grant you," said
he, as we resumed the usual quarter-deck step and
trod to and fro again: "it is a well-paying speculation,
a sealing expedition; and, by Jove! it would
need to be so to compensate poor fellows for all they
undergo in such a rigorous season, and in such seas
as those which sweep round the frozen rocks and
shores of Newfoundland and the drearier Labrador
in the blustering month of March.  Some crews
are frozen in, far at sea, for months and months, till
all perish of starvation; others are lost in detached
parties on the ice-fields, in fogs, and are never found
again.  Some are swept out to sea on broken floes,
or fall through holes in the ice, and are never more
seen.  Then the strongest ships are often crushed,
as you would crush an egg upon an anvil, by the
ice-fields, masses of which, perhaps a hundred miles
in extent, are whirled, dashed, and split against each
other by opposite currents, with a sound so frightful,
that one might well imagine the last day was at
hand, or that chaos had come again!  Ah, we should
have some profit, after encountering all that!"
</p>

<p>
"I should think so," said I while glancing at my
watch, and reflecting that Mr. Uriah Skrew would,
about this time, find the farewell letter I had left
for him on my desk in the counting-room.
</p>

<p>
"But I do not say all this, Jack Manly, to cast
you down," said Hartly, laughing; "for you will
always be safe with me, as you know I never can be
drowned, while wearing <i>this</i> ring."
</p>

<p>
"Do you really believe in it?" I inquired.
</p>

<p>
"Why, I don't know, Jack; but I should not
like to lose it now: we sailors have strange fancies
at times, but, with all our alleged superstition, are,
I cannot help thinking, more religious than you
landsmen.  One who finds his daily bread upon the
waters, and is for ever struggling with the wild
elements by night and day, must at times think
solemnly of the mighty Hand and Will that fashioned
them out of thin air."
</p>

<p>
"But your ring?"
</p>

<p>
"She who gave it me was a strange old woman,
whom we called Mother Jensdochter&mdash;a kind of
Norna of the Fitful Head, who lived, or for aught
I know, lives still, in a hut at the base of Mount
Hecla, in Iceland.  I was wrecked there, when on
a voyage in the <i>Princess</i>, of Hull, bound for Archangel,
five years ago.  This witch occupied a regular
Icelandic hut.  It was built of wreck and drift
wood, caulked with moss and earth, roofed with
rafters of whale-ribs covered with turf, and having
in the centre a hole for a chimney.  Her bed was a
mere box of seaweed, feathers, and down; but I
seldom saw any house of a better kind in Iceland."
</p>

<p>
"Well?"
</p>

<p>
"She used to sell fair winds or foul, blessings or
maledictions, as the matter might be, to the fishermen
of the fiords.  She would give, as the simple folks
believed, a fair wind that would carry a craft as far
as Cape Horn without lifting tack or sheet; or a
curse that would sink the <i>Royal Albert</i> line-o'-battle
ship, for a loaf of ground codfish, or a bottle of
hockettle oil for the iron cruse that hung from her
whalebone rafters; but she conceived a strong regard
for me, because I had saved her miserable life in a
snowstorm one night, and carried her in my
arms&mdash;ugh! what a precious armful she was!&mdash;to her
wigwam.  She used to assure me that whenever
there was a battle being fought anywhere in the
world, the terrible mountain that overhung her
dwelling vomited black ashes and stones; and
then, as she sat at her door, with her long grey
locks hanging over her fierce red eyes, she could
see troops of infernal spirits carrying the souls of
the damned, shrieking through the air, towards the
flaming crater.  The noise of the ice-floes dashed
against the shore, she alleged to be the groans of
others, who were doomed to endure excess of cold
for eternity, even as those in Hecla were to
endure excess of heat; and she had many other
fancies wild enough to make a poor Jack Tar's hair
stand up on end!
</p>

<p>
"Near her hut stood a conical knoll, covered
with fine green grass, and thence named the
Groenbierg.  There, she asserted, by putting an ear
to the ground, she could hear the large-headed
gnomes and little bandy-legged dwarfs, who dwelt
in it, busy at work, fashioning trinkets and curiously
carved goblets&mdash;especially at Yule, where the clink
of their tiny hammers rang like chime-bells on little
anvils; and the puff of their bellows and forge could
be heard, with the jingle of gold and silver coins, and
opening and shutting of quaintly-carved and
iron-bound treasure-chests, which they were shoving to
and fro, and hiding in the bowels of the mountain.
She fell asleep there one evening, and dreamed that
the Grcenbierg opened, and there came forth a little
man in a red cloak and pair of puffy breeches, with a
white beard the entire length of his body (that is,
about two feet,) and he bestowed this ring upon her,
with a promise that whoever wore it was free from all
danger hereafter.  He then vanished into a
mole-track on the hill-side.  Mother Jensdochter awoke,
and found the ring upon her finger, where it
remained, until, in a burst of gratitude, she bestowed
it on me, with the comfortable assurance (I give
you the yarn, Jack, for what it is worth) that I
'could never be drowned while it remained on my
finger.'  Hans Peterkin&mdash;forward there!"
</p>

<p>
"Ay, ay, sir."
</p>

<p>
"Brace those foreyards sharper up; set the fore
and main staysails and foretopmast staysail; and
keep her a point or so further off the land.&mdash;And
now, Jack, come below, for Cuffy has gone down
with the bacon and coffee, piping hot, too."
</p>

<p>
Leaving Hans, the second mate, in charge of the
deck, with orders to announce the slightest indication
of a change of wind, we descended to breakfast
with the appetites of hawks.
</p>

<p>
On this morning only two of our sealing
companions were visible, and these were at the far
horizon to the eastward; so as we were forced by
change of wind to hug the land, we soon lost sight
of them, and, ere noonday, were alone upon the sea.

<h3>
CHAPTER V.
<br /><br />
KIDD THE PIRATE.
</h3>

<p>
We had scarcely lost sight of Cape St. Francis when
the wind became light and variable, and one of those
dense fogs peculiar to that region settled surely
and slowly, densely and darkly, over land and sea.
We shortened sail, and sent ahead the jolly-boat
with four hands in her, to feel our way as it were;
while Paul Reeves kept sounding ever and anon,
for in that ocean of strong currents, with a slight
wind from the eastward, and a shore of reefs and
shoals upon our lee, every precaution was necessary.
</p>

<p>
The raw cold of a fog upon a wintry sea in that
latitude of ice and snow must be felt to be
understood.  The clear bracing frost, however intense,
may be endured; but this chill and murky dampness
made one intensely miserable.
</p>

<p>
As we crept along, a strange sound reached us
from time to time.
</p>

<p>
"What is that?" I asked.
</p>

<p>
"The voices of the penguins," replied Hartly&mdash;"the
Baccalao birds.  We are off that island; and
their cries are as good as fog-guns to people situated
as we are.  See! the fog lights a bit; and now
there is the land about two miles off, on the lee
bow!"
</p>

<p>
As he spoke, the dense bank of vapour which
shrouded sea, land, and sky, parted for a few
minutes; a gleam of brilliant sunshine fell upon the
rough and precipitous rocks of the wild and desert
isle named Baccalao, which, in summer and winter,
are alike ever whitened by a species of guano,
deposited there by the auks or penguins, which we
could see hovering above them in countless myriads,
uttering shrill cries while they soared, wheeled, and
flew hither and thither, as if to warn us of our
danger in being so near those treacherous reefs,
which are a source of terror to mariners.  Their
dangers are only seen, however, by the daring
egg-gatherers, who come from the mainland in summer,
and sling themselves by ropes from the summit of
the cliff, to rifle the nests; although these poor
birds are specially under the protection of Government,
by a proclamation, being sea-marks, or danger-signals
(as we found them) in foul or foggy weather.
</p>

<p>
With some interest I surveyed the stern cliffs of
Baccalao, as they were the first land seen by Cabot,
the Grand Pilot of England, after ploughing the
mighty Atlantic in his little caravel; and he named
them in his joy <i>La Prima Vista</i>, though a "vista"
grim enough.
</p>

<p>
"The shore is dark, dreary, and sterile," said I to
Hartly.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," said he, "but there are many strange
stories of treasure being buried there by the pirates
in old times."
</p>

<p>
"Do you see that deep chasm in the rocks in the
north end of the isle?" said Paul Reeves, lowering
his voice impressively as he pointed to the land.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, it seems quite black among the snow."
</p>

<p>
"That is <i>not</i> snow, but the deposit of the Baccalao
birds," said the mate.  "In the old buccaneering
times, the pirates are said to have buried their
treasure there; and a cask branded with the King's
broad arrow, and the name <i>Adventure</i>, was once found
in it.  Now all the world knows that the <i>Adventure</i>
was the ship of the famous Captain Kidd, who
cheated King William out of the finest craft in the
English navy."
</p>

<p>
"How?" said I.
</p>

<p>
"Let us hear," added Hartly.
</p>

<p>
"At a time when all the seas about the coasts of
North and South America and the West India
Islands were swarming with buccaneer craft, manned
by desperadoes of every country, who made war
upon all ships that sailed the ocean and were unable
to resist them, the Government of King William
III. selected a mariner of doubtful reputation, named
Captain William Kidd, who volunteered to root
out those sea-hawks, who persecuted the thrifty
traders of New Amsterdam."
</p>

<p>
"King William acted on the principle of setting
a thief to catch a thief."
</p>

<p>
"Exactly so, Jack," said Hartly, "for Kidd,
though ostensibly a merchant-mariner, was something
of a smuggler, and had done a little in the
way of picarooning.  He was always heard of in
out-of-the-way places, departing on voyages no one
knew whither, and coming from places never heard
of before.  Then he was always followed by a crew
of well-armed, black-muzzled, drinking, swearing,
tearing fellows, who were as flush of money as if
they had been at the overhauling of Havannah.
But go a-head, Paul."
</p>

<p>
"Well," resumed the mate, "in 1695 Kidd sailed
down Channel in the <i>Adventure</i> galley, of forty-four
guns, with a royal pennant flying, duly commissioned
by King William to fight all buccaneers, and
his crew were all selected by himself.  But Master
Kidd was barely off the Lizard when he hauled
down the King's pennant, hoisted the skull and
crossbones, and bore away for the East Indies.  He
burned two towns in Madeira, and after plundering
and sinking every craft he could overmatch, reached
the entrance of the Red Sea, where he captured a
Queda merchantman, the cargo of which lined the
pockets of himself and his followers to their
complete satisfaction.
</p>

<p>
"Queda is a town of Asia, situated on the western
coast of the peninsula of Malacca; and so Kidd was
cunning enough to attempt passing-off this capture
as a crusade against the enemies of Christianity; but,
unfortunately for him, the ship was commanded by
a Scotchman, and people did not believe in crusaders
under Orange William.
</p>

<p>
"A year or two after this, he was cruising off the
American coast, and in dread of the King's ships,
which were all on the look-out for him, he ran
north as far as Newfoundland, and was alleged to
have buried on its coast all the treasure amassed on
his long and rambling voyage; but <i>where</i>, no one
could exactly say, until the old barrel head, marked
<i>Adventure</i>, and bearing the King's broad arrow,
found in yonder cavern, seemed to indicate Baccalao
as being the place.  Moreover, he is known to have
run up Conception Bay in quest of the gold and
silver rocks which Frobisher and Sir Humphrey
Gilbert averred were to be seen there."
</p>

<p>
"Rocks of gold and silver!" said I, incredulously.
</p>

<p>
"They are only the fire-stones of the Red Indians,
and emit sparks when struck together," said
Hartly.[*]
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="footnote">
[*] They were the solid iron pyrites which deceived the early
navigators who visited these barren shores.  In the "List of
H.M. Royal Navy for 1701," we find among the "fifth-rates,
the <i>Adventure</i>, 120 men, 44 guns."
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"His treasure," continued the mate, "if he had
any, was never found; though <i>he</i> was, for Richard
Coote, Earl of Bellamont, and Governor of New
England, caught him one day in 1701, when
swaggering about the streets of Boston, and sent
him home to King William, who lost no time in
hanging him.  But he died as hard as he had lived,
for the rope broke with his weight in Execution
Dock, so he was reeved up again with a new one.
</p>

<p>
"He was hung in chains on the banks of the
Thames, but his body disappeared in the night, and
the sailors in London declared that he could neither
be hanged nor chained, as he had a <i>charmed</i> life,
having sold his poor soul to the devil.  Be that as
it may, on the <i>same night</i>, in 1701, my Lord
Bellamont was found dead in his bed at Boston, and
many affirmed that this event had some connexion
with Kidd's mysterious disappearance from the
gallows, as he was said to have been seen by some
of his old shipmates near the dead Governor's
house.
</p>

<p>
"Fishermen when jigging or trawling off Baccalao
in the clear moonlight nights, often saw a solitary
man sitting on the rocks at the mouth of yonder
cavern, but his figure always seemed to melt away
into the moonshine when any one approached; so a
story went abroad that the island was haunted by
the ghost of a drowned man.  However, a stout
fellow, named Tom Spiller, who was rather bolder
than the rest, and who lived alone at Breakheart
Point, where he had a little hut and stage for
drying the fish he caught, went off to the island one
night, when there was little cloud and a bright
moon.  The sea was calm, for there was but a puff
of wind off the land from time to time.
</p>

<p>
"Tom Spiller was a brave and devil-may-care
kind of fellow, whom I knew well, for he was an
old man when I went to sea with him first as a boy,
so I have often heard him tell the story without
variation or leeway, or shaking out a new reef by
way of a change.
</p>

<p>
"On approaching the island, he saw the solitary
figure sitting on the rocks at the mouth of the deep
black chasm, motionless, with his head resting, as it
were, sorrowfully on the palm of his right hand, and
his eyes fixed apparently on the sea that rippled to
his feet, though it boiled and roared in white foam
over the reefs that lay a few fathoms off outside.
</p>

<p>
"Tom steered his boat straight for the cave, and
now, when the towering rocks of the desert isle
were over his head, covered with thousands upon
thousands of wild auks, screaming, whirling, and
flapping their wings, as if to scare him away; when
the deep black chasm in which the sea was gurgling
and moaning yawned before him, and everything
seemed so weird and wan in the pale moonlight, he
<i>did</i> feel queer, and more so when the solitary man,
instead of melting into thin air as usual, turned his
white face towards him, and arose, just as he let go
the halyards, lowered the brown flapping sail, and
running his boat into the cave, adroitly noosed a
rope over a large stone to moor her, and stepped
ashore.  Tom's heart was beating wildly and
strangely, for he was determined to discover whether
this figure, which he had so often seen from the
sea, and which had so invariably eluded his brother
fishermen, was man, ghost, or devil.
</p>

<p>
"He perceived that the stranger was clad in an
old-fashioned dress, his coat having large metal
buttons, broad pocket-flaps, and deep cuffs.  He
was ghastly pale, his glassy eyes glistened in the
moonlight, and dark crimson blood was flowing
from what appeared to be a pistol-shot in his left
temple.
</p>

<p>
"'What seek you here?' he asked, in a voice so
hollow that the terrified fisherman, who now
repented sorely of his rashness, knew not whether the
sound came from the spectre's white lips, from the
depth of the dreary chasm, or from the sea.  'Speak,'
continued the figure, with mournful earnestness;
'what seek you?'
</p>

<p>
"'To discover who and what you are,' said Tom.
</p>

<p>
"'May you never be what I was, or what I am,'
replied the other, sadly.
</p>

<p>
"'But what are you?'
</p>

<p>
"'A restless spirit.'
</p>

<p>
"Tom's knees bent under him, for the pale
eyes of that cold white visage seemed to pierce his
soul.
</p>

<p>
"'A wretched spirit&mdash;left here by a fiend to
guard his ill-gotten spoil&mdash;so begone, I charge you.'
</p>

<p>
"The fisherman shrank back on hearing these
strange words, while the gloomy terrors of the
scene&mdash;the screaming of the Baccalao birds that whirled
in a cloud about him, the dashing of the waves
upon the reef, and the mournful gurgle of the
backwash within the vast cavern, with the weird
glimpses of the moon as the white clouds sailed
swiftly past her face&mdash;all combined to make this
interview a dreadful one.
</p>

<p>
"Suddenly there was a sound of oars to seaward,
the spirit seemed to become excited, and clasped his
thin white hands.
</p>

<p>
"'See! see! he comes!' he exclaimed.  'Kidd the
pirate!  Kidd, my murderer!  But he comes, blessed
be God! to release me after a hundred years of
restless watching and penance!'
</p>

<p>
"For you must know that this occurred, as Tom
Spiller told me, in 1801.
</p>

<p>
"'Land ho!' cried a deep hoarse voice from the
sea, while Spiller, overcome by terror, shrank behind
a fragment of rock.
</p>

<p>
"'Hilloa!' answered the spirit, in nautical
fashion.
</p>

<p>
"'Clouds and thunder! why the devil don't you
show a light?' cried the strange voice, as a large
barge full of men shot round a promontory, against
which the waves were dashing in foam.  On it
came&mdash;on and on&mdash;at every stroke of the oars, till
they were all triced up in true man-o'-war fashion
as she sheered into the creek, and a man sprang on
shore, uttering a tempest of oaths and maledictions.
</p>

<p>
"Tom Spiller now fancied that they were all
dressed in the fashion of a hundred years ago, with
deep square-skirted coats, long flowing perriwigs,
and little three-cocked hats, and that all were pale,
silent, and spectral; in short, it was a boat manned
by unquiet spirits!  Strangely enough, he felt less
afraid of them <i>all</i> than of <i>one</i>, and continued to
gaze at them like a person in a dream.
</p>

<p>
"The man who sprang ashore was a short, squat
fellow of ferocious aspect; his battered visage was
covered with cuts and patches of black plaster; a
hellish spark glittered in each of his eyes.  He
wore a coarse perriwig with long curls, a three-cocked
hat, an old-fashioned blue coat, covered with
tarnished lace, and brass buttons; he had also a
pair of brass-barrelled Spanish pistols, and a hanger
sustained by a broad belt.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Two</i> ropes were knotted round his neck, which
was bare, and pieces of rusty chain were dangling
at his wrists and ankles.  Then the marrow froze
in the bones of Tom Spiller, for he knew that he
looked upon William Kidd, the pirate, who had
been <i>twice</i> hanged a hundred years before in
Execution Dock.
</p>

<p>
"'Now, you canting, cowardly lubber, why the
henckers didn't you hang out a light?' he bellowed
in a hoarse voice.
</p>

<p>
"'I have been in the dark these hundred years,'
replied the spirit, meekly.
</p>

<p>
"'Likely enough; seas and thunder! you were
the faintest-hearted fellow in the <i>Adventure</i>.'
</p>

<p>
"'I suffered sorely at your hands since you
captured the ship of Queda, of which I was captain,
and made me a prisoner in yon galley.'
</p>

<p>
"'Bah!' thundered Kidd.
</p>

<p>
"'I have repented me of my sins in life,' said
the spirit, mournfully.
</p>

<p>
"''Sblood and plunder!' shouted the other, with
a diabolical laugh; 'I shot you through the head,
as a canting Scotsman, on this night one hundred
years ago, and buried you here&mdash;you know for what
purpose.'
</p>

<p>
"'That my unquiet spirit might watch your
buried treasure,' moaned the other.
</p>

<p>
"'Right,' chuckled the pirate; 'I shot you as I
would have done my lord the Earl of Bellamont,
though he was Governor of New England and Admiral
of all the seas about it, for that long-snouted
Dutch lubber, William of Orange, who sent him to
lord it over the Yankees.'
</p>

<p>
"'I have waited and watched your treasure long,
and now am anxious for the repose of the grave.'
</p>

<p>
"On hearing this, Kidd and his boat's crew
laughed, and gnashed their teeth; but a few there
were who wept and wailed heavily, and the sound
of their lamentation was fearful as it mingled with
the chafing of the surge.
</p>

<p>
"'I have some fine things stowed away here in
Baccalao,' said Kidd; 'but I have some that are
better still in the haunted Kaatskill Mountain, and
at Tapaan Zee, up the Hudson.'
</p>

<p>
"The spirit-watcher groaned.
</p>

<p>
"'Since I saw you last, brother, I have been
twice hanged and strung in chains on the banks of
the Thames&mdash;ha! ha! at Gravesend Reach.'
</p>

<p>
"'Hanged!'
</p>

<p>
"'Yes, by all the devils in New Amsterdam!&mdash;HANGED!
Hanged by order of him of pious,
glorious, and immortal memory&mdash;by Orange Billy,
who assassinated the De Witts in Holland, who
murdered eighty men, women, and children in cold
blood in Scotland; who abandoned his soldiers at
Steinkirk; who boiled and burned women alive in
London for coining a few brass halfpence; and who
departed this life amid the prayers of canting
hypocrites and lawn-sleeved parasites, on the 8th day of
March, 1701!  He roasts now, for some of his
pranks, I can tell you!  But heave a-head, brother! we
must ship our cargo, and be off to-night for Cape
Cod at New Amsterdam (or New York, as the folks
call it now-a-days), ere the moon wanes or the tide
falls.  Where is the plunder?'
</p>

<p>
"The sad spirit-watcher pointed to a place which
seemed to have opened in the rocky cavern; and
there Tom Spiller could see, by the beams of the
moon, heaps of gold and silver vessels, sparkling
jewels and trinkets, with veritable pyramids of gold
and silver coins of every nation and of every size,
piled up in confusion.
</p>

<p>
"Bewildered by this sight, he permitted rather
too much of his figure to be seen; for suddenly a
yell of rage came from the spectre boat's crew; and
Kidd, drawing one of the long brass pistols from his
broad buff girdle, uttered a dreadful oath&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"'A spy!' he exclaimed; 'take <i>that</i> and perish!'
</p>

<p>
"He fired full at the head of Tom, who felt the
ball pass through his brain like a red-hot arrow, and
he sank upon the rocks&mdash;where he found himself
lying stiff enough when he awoke next morning,
and saw the Baccalao birds wheeling about in the
sunshine."
</p>

<p>
"So the whole affair was only a dream!" said I.
</p>

<p>
"I cannot say," replied Reeves; "for strangely
enough, an old Spanish pistol, with a strong smell
of powder about it, and 'W. K.' on the butt, was
lying on the rocks by his side.  Tom lost no time,
you may be assured, in jumping into his boat, and
clapping on all sail to leave the island astern; but
after that night the spirit was seen no more at
the mouth of the cavern, for Kidd had come to
release him, or to take away his treasure."
</p>

<p>
"And Tom Spiller?"
</p>

<p>
"Forsook his hut at Breakheart Point, and went
to sea for many years: he felt unhappy, for the
parsons say that folks always are so who have
conversed with ghosts; but his mind dwelt for ever on
the treasure in the cavern, and he never ceased to
spin yarns about it, and express hopes that some, if
not all that he saw, might yet remain.  He returned
to Breakheart Point about twenty years ago, an old
and white-haired man; and one night, accompanied
by three men armed with picks and shovels, sailed
in search of the treasure; but they never reached
the island, for a tempest came on and drove their
boat to the northward.  He tried to fetch Ragged
Harbour, but was blown right across Conception
Bay for more than thirty miles, and was drowned
at La Cabo Bueno Vista, on a rock called, to this
hour, Spiller's Point.
</p>

<p>
"As for Captain Kidd, he has never been seen
since, though some folks hereabout say he commands
the <i>Black Schooner</i>, which has overhauled so many
of our merchantmen and escaped the Queen's
cruisers.  So that is my yarn, Mr. Manly."
</p>

<p>
"Steady, Paul, steady," said Hartly; "the fog
has concealed your haunted island again."
</p>

<p>
"Steady it is, sir; but we had better take a pull
at these larboard tacks, otherwise we may not be
able to clear the three rocks that lie to the
northward of Baccalao; and I think we can hear the
breakers already!"

<h3>
CHAPTER VI.
<br /><br />
THE BLACK SCHOONER.
</h3>

<p>
Long ere the mate's story was concluded, the dense
fog&mdash;chilly, white, and drenching&mdash;had shrouded the
dreary isle of Baccalao, and the voices of the
penguins alone indicated its locality; but they became
fainter, until we lost the sound altogether as we ran
further to the north.
</p>

<p>
Now a furious snow-storm came on; thick and
fast the white flakes fell ceaselessly aslant through
a dark-grey sky upon the winter sea (for in that
region there is <i>no</i> spring), covering the rigging, the
decks, and storm-jackets of the watch, who shrank
to leeward, while the wind, which blew keenly from
the N.N.E., and thermometer, which had sunk
very low, made me begin to reflect that there
were more unpleasant places in the world than the
counting-room of Mr. Uriah Skrew.
</p>

<p>
This snow-storm continued for three or four days,
during which the whole seamanship of Hartly,
Reeves, and Hans Peterkin was required to prevent
the <i>Leda</i> being driven upon a lee shore.  By chart
and soundings they were constantly at work, to
keep her off a land which was veiled in obscurity,
for the wind was dead and strong against us; and
frequently through the blinding snow, and grey
hazy drift to leeward, we could hear the sullen
booming of breakers, as they rolled in foam that froze
upon the granite rocks and islets about Cape Freels.
</p>

<p>
This foul weather lasted for several days, and
weary of beating fruitlessly to windward, when the
storm abated, and the sky became again blue and
serene, we found ourselves under easy sail, at the
rate of four knots an hour or so, passing the
Twillingate Isles, which lie between the Bay of Exploits
and the vast Bay of Notre Dame.  They were covered
with snow, and are desolate, bleak, and little known,
as on that part of the coast there are only about
one hundred and fifty inhabitants&mdash;poor people&mdash;who,
after fishing for cod and salmon in summer,
quit their wigwams in winter to live in the sheltered
woods, or sail south towards St. John.  And now we
began to get ready our boats and guns, and with
telescopes to sweep the snow-clad shore for seals,
and the open sea for ice-floes.
</p>

<p>
It was about the hour of six; the sun had just set,
and the western sky was all a-blaze with fiery-coloured
light, which tinged with roseate hues the
waves that rolled upon the bleak and snow-clad
shore.  Captain Hartly took the wheel, and Reeves
stood anxiously close by the binnacle, for we had to
weather a long, sharp, and lofty promontory which
abutted like a wall of rock into the ocean, and round
which there eddied a swift and dangerous current.
The wind, though now off the land, was too light to
enable us to make headway against the stream.
</p>

<p>
On the brig we had but little "way," and a general
exclamation of satisfaction rose from the hitherto
silent crew, when the <i>Leda</i> <i>shaved</i>&mdash;as they phrased
it&mdash;past the promontory, and we saw a deep cove
of blue water opening beyond it; but lo!
</p>

<p>
There lay at anchor a schooner&mdash;a long, low,
sharply prowed and rakish-like craft&mdash;with her hull
painted black as jet could be, and with a number of
rough-looking fellows crowding along her gunwale.
We were not three hundred yards apart.
</p>

<p>
"Reeves, take the wheel," cried Hartly, in an
excited voice.  "The glass, Cuffy, the spy-glass!" he
added with sharp energy, snatching from the hands
of Snowball the telescope which usually hung on
two hooks in the companion; "a row of ugly dogs
they are that man her.  By Heaven, she is the <i>Black
Schooner</i>!"
</p>

<p>
"The <i>Black Schooner</i>!" we all exclaimed with
something of dismay in our varying tones; and I felt,
that with Paul Reeves's grim legend about Captain
Kidd fresh in our memory, we had some cause for
alarm in meeting with this robber ship upon those
solitary seas.
</p>

<p>
"Are you sure, Hartly?" I asked.
</p>

<p>
"Not a doubt of it!  see, Reeves&mdash;she is a
two-topsail schooner!"
</p>

<p>
"What does that mean?" said I.
</p>

<p>
"A brig without tops, in fact."
</p>

<p>
A kind of growling cheer, mingled with wild and
insolent halloing, rose from her crew on beholding us
suddenly come round the abrupt promontory, from
the brow of which a fringe of gigantic icicles
overhung the sea.  A commotion was instantly
observable on deck; a man in authority sprang up the
companion-ladder, and we heard him in a loud and
clear voice ordering sail to be instantly made on the
schooner as we altered our course.
</p>

<p>
"Man the windlass-bars&mdash;up anchor&mdash;rouse it to
the catheads with a will, my boys!  Shake out
everything fore and aft&mdash;every stitch that will draw.
Stand by the jib and flying-jib halliards," he shouted.
</p>

<p>
After a pause, during which we heard the clanking
of the windlass pauls, as her anchor was started,
and would soon be a-cockbill, and dangling by its
ring, we heard his voice again.
</p>

<p>
"Up with the jib and flying-jib now&mdash;sheets to
starboard!  Heave and away&mdash;presto! my Jack
Spaniards.  Stand by topgallant and topsail sheets
and halliards.  Bear a hand, you French devils!
Well done, my Kentucky rowdies!"
</p>

<p>
In less than three minutes the swelling of the jib
and other head-sails, as well as the motion of the
schooner when her bows fell round, proved that she
was under weigh.  These orders, which were obeyed
with skilful alacrity, seemed to indicate alike the
mixed character of her crew and the hostility of
their intentions.
</p>

<p>
"Ready a gun there forward! sheet home and
hoist away, topsails and topgallant sails!"
</p>

<p>
This alarming order, uttered in a loud voice, rang
distinctly upon the clear frosty air, and, on the other
hand, Captain Hartly was not slow in his preparations
to avoid her.
</p>

<p>
"By Jove!" he exclaimed, "this is the very craft
we have heard so much about, and for the capture of
which the Governor offers 500<i>l</i>.  I have no wish to
be caught by these fellows&mdash;see, they are shaking
out a couple of reefs in her fore and aft mainsail
already!  Hands make all sail&mdash;Reeves, set everything
that will draw&mdash;square away the after yards."
</p>

<p>
"Ay, ay, sir," said Reeves, jumping about and
setting all the men to the yards, braces, and
halliards; "port the smallest bit&mdash;keep her
full&mdash;so&mdash;steady!"
</p>

<p>
"Maldito los Inglesos renegades!" ("Curse the
English runaways!") cried a Spaniard, shaking his
clenched hands at us over her starboard bow.
</p>

<p>
"Caramba!" cried another.
</p>

<p>
"Sangbleu!" added a Frenchman, "stop hare&mdash;lie
to&mdash;or it vill be ze vorser for you."
</p>

<p>
"Will it, you rascally thief!" shouted Hartly, as
his eyes flashed and his cheek glowed with
excitement: "Manly, look alive, my lad! load all the
double-barrelled rifles in the cabin.  Snowball, get up
the kegs of powder and slugs.  We shall not be
overhauled by a pirate without having a skirmish
first."
</p>

<p>
"Luckily for us the wind is off the land, and it
freshens too," said Reeves: "we shall beat her when
running before the wind; but she would come up
with us hand over hand on a taut bowline.  It was
on a wind she overtook the Bristol clipper."
</p>

<p>
In the red glow of the winter sunset, we saw the
foam flying on each side of her sharp bows as the
breeze freshened, and she rolled heavily from side to
side; while the <i>Leda</i>, being square-rigged, had a
greater spread of canvas, and caught more of the
wind: thus, notwithstanding that our dangerous
pursuer was built for sailing fast, as Paul Reeves
foretold, she was no match for us, when running
right before the wind.
</p>

<p>
Our crew, half of whom were only poor seal-fishers,
became very much excited; but inspired by the
example of Hartly, Reeves, and myself, they proceeded
to load all the sealing guns and muskets, lest the
schooner might lower her boats to overtake us and
attempt to board.
</p>

<p>
The stern and confident order to get "ready a
gun," was repeated more than once before we got
beyond hearing; but as no gun was ever fired, we
believed this to be a mere bravado to frighten us
into shortening sail, till she might run alongside
and board us, when a ruinous scene of plunder, if not
of bloodshed, would be sure to ensue.
</p>

<p>
"She sails with the speed of an arrow," said I,
while carefully loading and capping my rifle.
</p>

<p>
"This <i>Black Schooner</i> was one of the craft employed
in protecting the French fishery of Miquelon,
on the south side of the island," said Hartly; "but
her crew mutinied, shipped some runaways of all
countries and colours, and turned slavers.  These
rascals have committed several outrages hereabouts
by sea and land, but have always escaped our cruisers,
as she alternately shows a British, French, and
Yankee ensign, and runs all kinds of paint-strokes
along her bends."
</p>

<p>
On, on, we bore; and on, on, she came after us,
with the still freshening breeze, the foam flying
before her bows and ours; but ere long we were
evidently half a mile apart.
</p>

<p>
She was a handsome clipper-like craft of about
two hundred tons' burthen, coppered to the bends;
her lower masts were long and heavy, so as to carry
fore and aft sails of immense spread upon a wind,
with a square sail, top and topgallant sail aloft.
</p>

<p>
"Massa Hartly&mdash;Massa Captain&mdash;look out!"
exclaimed Cuffy Snowball, who had armed himself
with a musket, and stood in soldier-fashion at "the
ready," grinning over the taffrail at the rolling
schooner.
</p>

<p>
"Look out for what?" said Hans Peterkin.
</p>

<p>
"Something make you all look white as de
debbil."
</p>

<p>
"What do you mean by <i>white</i>," asked the carpenter,
"when we all know the devil is black?"
</p>

<p>
"In my country him white, sare," replied Cuffy,
angrily.
</p>

<p>
"Then," said Hartly, to keep up the spirits of
his crew by jesting, "what colour do you think he
is, Cuffy?"
</p>

<p>
"I tink him <i>blue</i>," replied the prudent negro;
and then he added with a yell, "dere come
something will make you look blue too, Massa!"
</p>

<p>
As he spoke, a puff of white smoke rose from the
bow of the <i>Black Schooner</i>; the report of a musket
rang in the air, and a conical rifle-ball whistled
past the ear of Hartly, and sank with a heavy
<i>thud</i> into the mainmast.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap07"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER VII.
<br /><br />
THE CHASE.
</h3>

<p>
Cuffy Snowball fired his musket at our pursuer,
whether with or without effect we know not; but,
in reply, a confused discharge of firearms followed,
and the balls pattered among the rigging, and
knocked little splinters from our spars and gunwale.
</p>

<p>
"Now, my lads," said Hartly, "let fly at her
with everything you have&mdash;sealing-guns and rifles!"
</p>

<p>
This order was executed with alacrity.  We had
four good rifles and ten long-barrelled and
wide-muzzled sealing-guns, each of which sent ten or
twelve slugs of lead <i>whirring</i> through the air at
every discharge, and we blazed away right valiantly
at the crowd of rascals in the schooner's bows; but
so great was the distance between us, that I am
certain our fire fell harmlessly into the sea&mdash;the
rifle shots alone could have told with effect.
</p>

<p>
On first deliberately levelling my rifle (a fine
Enfield, presented to me by my father on leaving
Peckham) at a man in the starboard bow of the
pirate, a strange sensation came over me!
</p>

<p>
I lowered my weapon and paused; but a shot
that struck one of the davits at which the
stern-boat hung, removed my momentary, and at that
unpleasant crisis most unnecessary scruple.
</p>

<p>
I levelled again&mdash;fired and reloaded, and without
considering whether or not I had killed a man,
continued to pepper away with all the coolness and
precision of Cuffy Snowball, the ex-corporal of
H.M. West India Regiment.
</p>

<p>
"Run up our ensign, and let her rascally crew
see it while there is light," said Hartly.  "Paul
Reeves, rig out the lower studding-sail booms
forward, and bring aft those two carronades and the
small anchor, to trim her more by the stern.  Tom
Hammer, see to this!"
</p>

<p>
"Ay, ay, sir," was the ready response.
</p>

<p>
The orders were promptly obeyed.  The small
anchor and two little guns, for which we unfortunately
had only powder for signals, were brought aft;
the sharp bows of the <i>Leda</i> thus rode more easily
over the water.  The lower studding-sails were rapidly
spread and hoisted up; and then we flew through
the darkening sea till its water seemed to smoke
alongside, and bubbled in snowy froth under the
counter, leaving a long white wake, like that of a
steamer, astern.
</p>

<p>
Closely in this long wake followed our pursuer,
with deadly pertinacity.
</p>

<p>
It is impossible to convey in words any idea of
the excitement of this chase&mdash;this flight and
pursuit&mdash;this race of rivalry, of life and death!
The daring ruffians who manned the schooner had
committed several murders and robberies on sea and
land.  They had overhauled and rifled several
merchant ships, carrying off compasses, charts,
provisions, watches, money, and everything of
value: thus, to have undergone such a ransacking
at their hands&mdash;even if our lives were spared&mdash;would
effectually have marred our expedition for
that year.
</p>

<p>
They were evidently well armed, for their rifle-balls
flew thick and fast about us.  The cracking
report, and the <i>pingeing</i> sound of the conical shot
that followed every red flash which broke over the
sharp bows of the schooner, added considerably to
our anxiety to escape, and to our exasperation at
being thus molested on the high seas, and within
two hundred miles of where we had left one of her
Majesty's sloops of war in the harbour of St. John,
but frozen in, unfortunately.
</p>

<p>
Though these missiles struck the brig's stern and
rigging incessantly, we had only one man hit&mdash;an
Irish seal-fisher, who had left a wife and family at
Dead Man's Bay, to try his fortune with us in the
North.  A ball pierced his shoulder, smashing the
collar-bone; and the poor fellow sank on the deck
with a shrill cry of agony.  A lad named Ridly
had his cheek grazed by another shot.
</p>

<p>
The dusk was fast increasing; but the red flush of
the winter sunset yet lingered in the western sky;
the snow-clad islets that stud the Bay of Exploits
had assumed a dark purple hue, and the sea through
which we were careering, northwest, towards the Bay
of Notre Dame, wore a deep and sombre blue.
</p>

<p>
Clearly defined against the dusky and ruddy sky,
we could see the pursuing schooner, her tall slender
spars swaying from side to side, with every stitch
of snow-white canvas spread upon them; and she
tore through the waves like a giant bird, swimming
in the wake of dead water that ran like a long path
astern of us.
</p>

<p>
We had everything set aloft and alow; to her
very trucks the <i>Leda</i> was covered with swelling
canvas, and she was a beautiful sight!  The keen
and anxious eyes of Hartly, who was at the wheel,
scanned ever and anon the taut cordage, the bending
masts, and then he would cast a fierce glance
astern.
</p>

<p>
"We are leaving her fast, sir," said Paul Reeves,
confidently; "in another hour we shall be far
enough apart to feel comfortable."
</p>

<p>
"Bravo, my little <i>Leda</i>!" responded my friend;
"she is trimmed and masted to perfection!  You see,
Jack, how a square-rigged craft has the advantage
over even a sharp little serpent with a floating
sheet, like that rascally schooner!"
</p>

<p>
Her crew still continued to blaze at us with
their rifles; but ere long the bullets fell far short,
for we were now more than a thousand yards apart,
and with cheers of derision we continued to surge
through the darkening ocean.
</p>

<p>
"If we had only possessed a few round-shot, we
might have knocked some of their sticks away
with these two useless carronades," said Hartly, as
he now relinquished the wheel to Hans Peterkin,
his second mate, and ordered glasses of grog to be
served all round.  "Corporal Cuffy, do you think
you could have knocked her mainboom away, when
the sea is so smooth?"
</p>

<p>
"Like to knock all him brains out!" replied the
Congo-man with a savage grin; for, inspired by
some of his old African instincts, Snowball was the
only person on board who regretted that we had
not enjoyed a hand-to-hand conflict with these
outlaws.
</p>

<p>
But now the darkness of the descending night,
together with the gathering clouds and haze,
concealed the schooner from us.
</p>

<p>
We extinguished all lights on board, and ere long
when a red spark about seven miles astern indicated
that she was still tracking us, Hartly took in his
studding-sails, reduced the canvas on the brig,
brought his larboard tacks on board, and bore up
for Cape St. John, the boundary of the French
shore, to land our wounded man, who was suffering
great agony from his compound fracture, and with
whom, as we had no medical officer, it would have
been impossible to pursue our voyage.
</p>

<p>
This rencontre, chase, and escape, formed a staple
topic for conversation to all on board, and till the
night was far advanced no one thought of turning
in.
</p>

<p>
When day broke we found ourselves close in
shore, on the northern side of the great Bay of
Notre Dame, with Cape St. John bearing about three
miles off on our lee bow.  We swept the sea with
our glasses, but not a sail was visible in the offing,
nor all along the snow-clad coast.  Save Cuffy
Snowball, all expressed their satisfaction at this;
but we were not yet entirely done with our sable
acquaintance, the <i>Black Schooner</i>.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap08"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER VIII.
<br /><br />
OUR REVENGE SCHEMED.
</h3>

<p>
We came to anchor, handed our topsails, but
merely hauled up our courses, so as to be ready for
sea at a moment's notice.  We were in a little
sheltered cove, abreast of a small village of wooden
huts, surrounded by fences that were buried deep
in the frozen snow.
</p>

<p>
These huts, like all others in this wild terra
nova, were built of fir-poles with the bark on,
braced or pegged closely together, and having
chimneys of rough stone built without mortar.
Bark and sods formed the roofs, and all the crevices
were carefully caulked with moss and mud.
</p>

<p>
There, in a wretched and dreary region, dwelt&mdash;and,
I presume, still dwell&mdash;a little Irish colony of
fifty or sixty poor souls, who fished for cod in
summer and seals in winter, each family herding
together for warmth in the same apartment with
their pigs, fowls, and the shaggy dogs which dragged
in harness the stunted trees that formed their fuel,
and which were cut in the adjacent bush&mdash;the
desolate place which once formed the summer
hunting-grounds of the extinct Red men of the island.
</p>

<p>
Our anchoring in the cove was a great event&mdash;the
entire population came forth to gaze and their
dogs to bark at us.
</p>

<p>
Though Newfoundland is larger than England
and Wales together, it is indented by broad bays of
deep water, which run for forty or fifty miles into
the interior, and are but little known.  On some of
these solitary shores are little stations of Europeans,
such as this we visited, so remote from all intercourse,
and so secluded, that their reckoning of time
has become confused as to days, months, and even
years; thus Sunday is frequently held by them in
the <i>middle</i> of a week.
</p>

<p>
To the care of these pioneers, or squatters, we
consigned our wounded man.  By the intensity of
the frost mortification had commenced, so the poor
fellow died a few days after being landed.
</p>

<p>
We had scarcely conveyed him ashore, when a
man arrived from the bush with a large tree, which
he had cut down, and which his dogs had dragged
easily over the snow (after it was denuded of its
bark and branches) in the usual manner, by having
their traces secured to his hatchet, which was
wedged in the broad end of the log.  He informed
us that a schooner&mdash;by his description, our identical
<i>Black Schooner</i>&mdash;was then at anchor under the lee
of the Gull Island, about five miles distant; and
added that the poor French people at La Scie
complained bitterly of the rifling they had undergone at
the hands of her crew, which consisted of forty
well-armed desperadoes, of all nations, but principally
English and Frenchmen.
</p>

<p>
Here was startling intelligence!
</p>

<p>
"Only five miles distant, say you?" reiterated
Hartly.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sir; and you may see Gull Island from the
mouth of our cove here."
</p>

<p>
"You are sure she is a schooner?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, with masts raking well aft."
</p>

<p>
"All black in the hull, with slender spars and
double topsails?"
</p>

<p>
"Sure as I now spake to yer honour," replied our
informant, who was an Irish fisherman and squatter;
"her crew have let go both anchors to make all
snug, and gone in a gang to enjoy themselves, or
rob&mdash;which you plaze&mdash;I suppose it's all one to
them, at La Scie; bad luck to them, and may the
devil fly away with them all!"
</p>

<p>
"Are they all gone?"
</p>

<p>
"All except six rapparees, whom I could count
from the bush where I was hiding."
</p>

<p>
"Six&mdash;left as a deck-watch, I suppose?"
</p>

<p>
"Just so; yer honour's right again."
</p>

<p>
"How long have you lived here?" I inquired,
for his brogue was as strong as if he had only left
his native Kerry yesterday.
</p>

<p>
"I have lived here, plaze yer honor, five-and-forty
years this last St. Patrick's Day, and have
niver had an hour's illness, glory be to God!"
</p>

<p>
"Five-and-forty years!" I reiterated, with a
shudder, while surveying the snow-clad wilderness
amid which the wigwams stood.
</p>

<p>
"How far is La Scie from the Gull Island?" said
Hartly, after a pause.
</p>

<p>
"Six miles, capthin."
</p>

<p>
"Then by Heaven I'll burn her to the water-edge,
or sink her at her anchors!" exclaimed
Hartly, who, with all the rapidity of his nature,
at once conceived and prepared to execute a very
daring scheme.
</p>

<p>
While the quarter-boat was got ready, and four oars,
with as many rifles loaded and capped, and a case
of ammunition, were put into her, Hartly, with Paul
Reeves, proceeded in the most simple and methodical
manner to prepare their apparatus for burning the
piratical schooner.
</p>

<p>
He took a common ship-bucket, and secured an
iron ring to the iron handle, for a purpose to be
afterwards explained.  He filled this bucket with
pieces of rope and spun-yarn, well steeped in tar
and grease, mixing them with rosin and gunpowder.
They were nearly three hours in getting these
combustibles prepared to their complete satisfaction;
and so impatient were they to put their scheme in
execution, that they would scarcely wait until dusk
to make the attempt.  But the moment the sun set,
Hartly issued orders to Paul Reeves and Hans
Peterkin to heave short on the anchor to get it
apeak, to cast loose the topsails, and prepare the jib
for hoisting; and while he started along the coast
in the quarter-boat, to follow him under easy sail,
keeping pretty well to windward of Gull Island, and
out of sight of the schooner.  If the night became
obscure, on hearing the report of a rifle a blue light
was to be burned on board the <i>Leda</i>, to indicate her
whereabouts.
</p>

<p>
While Paul Reeves got the brig under weigh,
and, favoured by a very light breeze, crept slowly
out of the cove, Bob Hartly, with Hammer the
carpenter, Cuffy Snowball, and I, started in the
sharp little quarter-boat, and aided by a current
which there runs north to Cape St. John, pulled
swiftly along the shore towards Gull Island, which
lies beyond the extremity of the headland.

CHAPTER IX.
<br /><br />
OUR REVENGE EXECUTED.
</h3>

<p>
The evening, as it deepened into night, was calm
and beautiful: as yet the moon had not risen, but
the sky was clear, with an intensity and purity
of blue that can only be found in the icy north, and
studded by ten thousand sparkling stars.  Some of
these were so bright as almost to cast our shadows
on the smooth water as we stretched to our oars,
and swept along the snow-white coast.
</p>

<p>
The latter being nearly destitute of inhabitants,
after we left the cove was voiceless, silent, and
desolate.  Not a light was visible, and no sounds
broke the stillness save the booming of the surf on
the rocks of Cape St. John, our own hard breathing,
and the clatter of the oars in the rowlocks.  Then
(as that is a species of noise which the water
conveys to a vast distance) we proceeded to muffle them
by our handkerchiefs, and once more we stretched
out vigorously.
</p>

<p>
Notwithstanding the intensity of the cold, so
invigorating was the exercise of rowing, and so full
were our minds of excitement and of our project for
destroying the pirate schooner, that we all felt in a
glow of heat, and almost uttered a shout when, after
pulling about three miles, on clearing the bluff Cape
of St. John, on the flinty brow of which the spray
was frozen white as it was dashed up by the sea,
we saw the steep rocks of Gull Island; and at
anchor, half a mile to leeward of it, the dark hull
and tall spars of the <i>Black Schooner</i>!
</p>

<p>
The increasing light at one part of the horizon
showed that the moon would shortly be up, so we
pulled with might and main to get close under the
lee of the island, and out of the long brilliant track
the Queen of Night would shortly send across the
rippling ocean.
</p>

<p>
"I might have brought an auger and bored a
hole or two in her sheathing under water, and so
have scuttled her quietly at her anchors," said the
carpenter.
</p>

<p>
"But that boring would have kept us alongside
too long," said Hartly; "and the rascals might
have got some of their plunder out before she went
down; moreover, your auger would have made too
much noise.  But, hush! we are seen&mdash;two fellows
are looking over her side!"
</p>

<p>
"All her boats are gone," said I.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, to La Scie, except one at the stern."
</p>

<p>
"They are hailing us, sir," said Hammer.
</p>

<p>
"Hush!  I'll weather the ruffians yet," said
Hartly.
</p>

<p>
We spoke in whispers, while our hearts beat like
lightning, as we knew not the issue of our attempt,
or the moment we might be fired on from her deck.
The schooner rode with both her anchors out, to
make sure of her holding-ground in case a squall
came suddenly on.  Her canvas was neatly handed,
her fore and aft foresail and boom mainsail were
tightly brailed up, and her topgallant yards sent
down.
</p>

<p>
Though black and sombre, with nothing light
about her save her copper, which shone brightly as
burnished gold in the clear and starlit sea, she was
a beautiful little vessel; and Hartly almost sighed
on thinking that he was about to destroy instead of
capturing her.
</p>

<p>
"She is a lovely craft!" said he, "sharp at the
bows as a needle below the water-line, clear at the
counter, and coppered to the bends.  What a
glorious yacht she would make!"
</p>

<p>
"In sheering alongside, take care, sir, they don't
scuttle us&mdash;by a cold shot, or a large stone," said
Hammer.
</p>

<p>
"Well," replied Hartly, "my friend the Greenland
witch said I should never drown; but that does
not prevent me from being shot, or hung from the
schooner's topsail yard."
</p>

<p>
As we pulled round across her bows to starboard,
keeping pretty well off, we were hailed again.
</p>

<p>
"Boat&mdash;boat ahoy! what are you?"
</p>

<p>
"Fishermen," replied Hartly.
</p>

<p>
"From where?"
</p>

<p>
"La Scie, where all your fellows are enjoying
themselves."
</p>

<p>
"Got any feesh?" asked a Frenchman.
</p>

<p>
"No&mdash;not at this season."
</p>

<p>
"Any zeels?"
</p>

<p>
"Seals&mdash;no."
</p>

<p>
"Then prenez-garde, messieurs."
</p>

<p>
"Which means, in plain English, sheer off, d&mdash;n
your eyes!" growled the first speaker; but by this
time we were close under her starboard counter.
</p>

<p>
"Sheer off, or it may be the worse for you!"
</p>

<p>
"What the devil are you lubbers about under the
counter?" exclaimed another; "Baptiste, hand me
a musket&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"We have dropped an oar, and our boat has run
foul of yours," replied Hartly; adding, in a whisper,
"The gimlet, carpenter&mdash;quick, the gimlet!"
</p>

<p>
In less time than I have taken to write these last
half-dozen lines, Hartly had screwed the long gimlet
into the vessel's side, under her counter, and hooked
on the bucket, through the iron ring which he had
secured to its handle, and there it hung close to the
rudder and stern-post.  By the swift application of
a single lucifer-match he fired the touch-paper that
was to light the carefully-prepared combustibles,
the gathering flame of which shot upward from the
bucket, and began at once to lick and flicker on the
newly-painted planking of the schooner.
</p>

<p>
"Shove off, and give way&mdash;for your lives, give
way!" said Hartly, in a hoarse whisper.
</p>

<p>
"Cut away stern-boat&mdash;let hims all burn&mdash;agh! agh!"
grinned Cuffy, who, by a slash of the knife
which hung at his neck, cut adrift the boat which
was moored astern.  We had not intended thus to
destroy the retreat of the wretches on board, but
the African was merciless to his enemies, and we
had no time to repair his severity.
</p>

<p>
"Give way," shouted Hartly, as soon as we were
clear of her; "clap on dry nippers!  By Jove! those
lads of the knife and pistol will never come athwart
the hawse of the <i>Leda</i> again!"
</p>

<p>
We had not pulled ten strokes from her, ere a flame
seemed to play on the water beneath her counter!
</p>

<p>
It spread rapidly between the rudder and sternpost,
burning through outer and inner sheathing;
penetrating the rudder-case, and reaching the cabin,
which was unoccupied, as all the crew were ashore
save the six already mentioned, whom we saw
loitering amidships.  One was provided with a
musket, which no doubt he would have discharged
at us, had we lingered another moment alongside.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly they raised a shout; then we saw them
rush aft, when they immediately discovered the
vessel to be on fire, and that their only boat was
adrift!
</p>

<p>
He with the musket took a long aim at us, and
fired; but as we were now three hundred yards
from the schooner, and our boat was alternately
rising and falling on the long rolling swell that
heaved between Gull Island and Cape St. John, his
shot fell far from us.
</p>

<p>
By this time the schooner was hopelessly on fire;
her whole quarter-deck, stern, and cabin, forward to
the mainmast, were sheeted with red and roaring
flame.  It spread along the deck; it leaped up the
well-greased masts like a fiery corkscrew, round the
tarred rigging and over the handed canvas, till
everything was in a blaze; the great fore and aft sails
fell from their brails like fiery curtains; then we
saw her two tall, slender spars, the long boom of
her mainsail, her towering gaffs and topsail yards,
all swaying to-and-fro, as the decks fell in and the
shrouds sank smouldering into the sea.  Then everything
went to cinders fore and aft&mdash;aloft and alow!
</p>

<p>
A lurid glare that outshone the light of the
rising moon, overspread the calm blue sea, casting a
ruddy glow upon our faces as we paused upon our
oars, close to the island, where the weird
illumination scared all the sea-birds; thus we heard the
shrill scream of the wagel or great grey gull, as he
rose with booming wings and flew to seek the
darker waters of the offing or the frozen bluffs of
Cape St. John, on which the thundering breakers
as they reared their heads, gleamed in the double
light of red and silver, like showers of diamonds and
rubies.
</p>

<p>
"Jack&mdash;see how she burns!" said Hartly: "there
goes her mainmast crash into the sea&mdash;and now the
foremast, a mass of whizzing sparks, with all its
top-hamper!  Pull for the island, till the brig comes
abreast of it;" and then cheerily he sang&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Haul away, pull away, pull, jolly boys!<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the mercy of fortune we go,<br />
  <i>We're in for it now</i>, and 'tis all folly, boys,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To be faint or downhearted, yeho!"<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
By this time the schooner was a mass of fire, and
burnt down nearly to her bends.  Through the
flames we could see the blackened stumps of her
timber-heads, standing in a row from stem to stern.
Suddenly there was an explosion, and a mighty
column of red and blue sparks and burning brands
shot into mid air, arching over in every direction
as they fell hissing into the sea.
</p>

<p>
A quantity of powder had exploded on board!
</p>

<p>
Just at that moment we beached our boat upon
Gull Island, and ascended the rocks in haste to view
the result of our handiwork.
</p>

<p>
A great cloud of smoke was now settling over
her, as the flames approached the water; and beyond
this cloud we could see a little boat with some men
in it, pulling in the direction of Cape St. John.
Hartly was pleased on seeing this; for although he
had resolved to destroy the schooner, his heart
reproached him for leaving six of the pirates to perish
in her.  One, no doubt, had swum after their drifting
boat, and brought her alongside in time to save his
five shipmates; and then we laughed on thinking
how cold his swim would be in the wintry waves,
and of the baffled rage of the ruffians at La Scie,
left there without a vessel or any means of escape
from a desolate fishing-station, which in a week or
two more would have, perhaps, three hundred miles
of field-ice between it and the sea.
</p>

<p>
A faint hurrah now came from seaward.  We
turned, and saw the smart and saucy <i>Leda</i> with her
foresail backed flat to the mast, and her maintopsail
full and swelling&mdash;her straight sharp hull, and her
taut rigging, in all its details, clearly and distinctly
defined against the vast silver disc of the moon,
which seemed to linger as it rose from the flat
horizon of the distant offing.  There was no need of
showing lights on board the brig, as we could see
each other distinctly, and also the burning pirate.
No flame rose from her now; but a vast black pall
of smoke enveloped all her hull.
</p>

<p>
From the centre of this, there came a sound like
a deep sob, as she filled and went down.  Then
when the smoky pall arose and melted into thin
air, not a vestige could be seen of the <i>Black
Schooner</i>!
</p>

<p>
"And now, my lads, away for the brig," said
Captain Hartly, as we descended from the highest
part of the island to reach our boat, passing through
deep snow, among thickets of dwarf firs and great
juniper trees&mdash;over rocks covered with savin and
frozen furze, where, in the short season of summer,
the wild Indian tea called <i>wisha-capucoa</i> grew
plentifully, and where the beaver and the musk-rat
had their holes.
</p>

<p>
As we floundered down to the creek, a yell from
Cuffy Snowball, who was behind, startled us all.  A
wild cariboo deer had rushed past him.  How it
came on the island puzzled us, for usually in winter
these animals seek the forests of the interior, till
the sun of the brief summer melts the snow, and
enables them to browse on the scanty herbage of
<i>the barrens</i>, as the cleared patches of moorland are
named by the squatters.
</p>

<p>
"If the Governor adheres to his proclamation,
this night's work adds five hundred pounds to our
profits," said Hartly, as the crew received us with
hearty cheers; the headsails were filled, and we at
once stood off the shore.
</p>

<p>
Next morning, when day broke, we could see by
our glasses a band of men assembled on the
snow-covered summit of Cape St. John.
</p>

<p>
These were evidently the outwitted crew of the
schooner; so, hoisting the ensign at our gaff-peak,
Paul Reeves dipped it to them thrice, ironically
bidding them farewell, as we stood away to the
eastward to make up for the time we had lost in
being driven, by their attack and pursuit, so far
out of the course our captain first intended to steer.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER X.
<br /><br />
THE SEAL-FISHERS.
</h3>

<p>
Some days after this event, we saw the dark blue of
the sea flecked at the horizon by white spots.  These
increased in size as we approached, and proved to be
the floes, or detached portions of a vast field of ice,
coming down from Davis' Straits, and with them
came masses of strange sea-weed, uprooted from the
bottom of the ocean, as some writers aver, by the
mighty tusk of the male narwhal when searching
for food.
</p>

<p>
We were soon amid the floes, and after passing
through them, Paul Reeves from the fore-crosstrees
announced that he could discern the field of ice,
extending along the whole line of the horizon; and we
soon became sensible of its vicinity by a very
perceptible increase of the cold, which ere long became
almost unbearable.  But our seal-fishers prepared with
alacrity for the great work of our little expedition,
by getting up their wooden clubs, their long
sealing-guns, and shot-pouches; their knives, sledges, and
rue-raddies or collar-ropes, by which to drag the
loads of skins to the brig, as they might have to
pursue and slaughter the seals for some miles from
where she would anchor by the outer edge of the ice.
The inner, Hartly knew by his observations, partly
rested on Wolf Island, off the coast of Labrador.
</p>

<p>
On the detached floes, we saw a few seals like black
dots; but on the ice nearing the brig they always
disappeared.
</p>

<p>
"There they go, souse into the water, tail up
for old Greenland!" said Hans Peterkin.  "Now,
Cuffy, get your fiddle in order."
</p>

<p>
"A fiddle!" said I; "for what?"
</p>

<p>
"That you shall soon see, Jack," said Hartly.
"Paul Reeves, get ready a gang with the ice-anchor
and cable!"
</p>

<p>
As we neared the scene of our operations, we
passed ten or twelve gigantic icebergs, the bases of
which were merged deep in the icy sea.  Solemnly
still, and intensely cold and pure they seem, to those
who first behold these voiceless floating mountains,
so terrible in their form and whiteness, the shades of
which are blue.
</p>

<p>
By a telescope, I perceived that some of them
bore masses of gravel, frozen mud, and even enormous
boulder-stones, torn from the shore&mdash;but from
what shore?
</p>

<p>
From unknown and untrodden lands beyond the
Arctic Circle&mdash;shores where, perhaps, the last of
Franklin's fated crew are lying unburied save by the
eternal snow; and while I gazed on these floating
islands, so awful in their aspect and solitude and so
mysterious in their formation, there came to memory
the oft-quoted words of the Psalmist, how "they
who go down to the sea in ships, and occupy their
business in great waters, see the works of the Lord,
and His wonders in the deep."
</p>

<p>
No small care, skill, and seamanship were requisite
to avoid those perilous "wonders;" but erelong we
were close to the mighty field of ice which covered
all the ocean to the far horizon&mdash;a white and
desolate expanse, like a snow-covered moorland&mdash;varied
only by the incessant hummocks, as those ridges of
broken ice formed by the collision of ice-fields, are
named; or by the wavy outline or sharp spiral
pinnacles of bergs which were wedged in the
floating mass, and seemed to form the crags and
mountains of this white and desolate world of ice and
snow.
</p>

<p>
We considered it singular, that up to this time
we had not seen a single ship bent on the same
errand, either of those which sailed with us on
St. Patrick's Day through the Narrows of St. John, or
any of the steam sealers which leave the northern
ports of Scotland about the same season of the
year.
</p>

<p>
Now the quarter-boat was lowered, and Paul
Reeves with her crew took off the cable and ice-anchor,
which is formed like a pick-axe; the courses
were hauled up, the fore and aft mainsail brailed, the
topsails and topgallant sails handed, and we warped
close to the ice-field, fairly coming to anchor
alongside its edge, just as we might have warped close to
a quay or wharf.
</p>

<p>
This was about ten in the morning of the 25th of
March, and after receiving a glass of stiff rum-grog
per man, the whole of our seal-fishers "landed," as
they phrased it, on the ice, with all their apparatus,
including Cuffy with his violin; and, after, three
hearty hurrahs for Captain Hartly, proceeded in quest
of their prey, scores of which were seen dotting the
white ice-scape (if I may so term it) within the
distance of a mile from the brig.
</p>

<p>
Seals of every species live or consort in droves
along those desolate shores where the bergs and
ice-fields float; and they are often found basking in
the rays of the sun.  Thus, when falling asleep they
easily become a prey, though, when reposing, the
seal is cunning enough to open its large black eyes
from time to time, to see whether all is quiet around
it.  The female produces two or three at a litter,
and feeds them for a fortnight or so on the shore
where she has brought them forth, suckling them in
a position nearly upright, till the fattened cubs
depart to see the Arctic world upon the ice-floes,
and are old enough to search the waves for food.
</p>

<p>
Armed with my double-barrelled rifle and a
sheathed knife that dangled at my shot-belt, and
well prepared to encounter the cold by a suit of the
warmest clothing (Flushing lined with English
blanket), I set out alone in quest of adventures,
feeling a strange emotion of mingled alarm and delight
on finding myself afoot upon that frozen sea.  The
intense purity and rarity of the atmosphere carried
the voices of our scattered men to a vast distance.
I could hear Cuffy vigorously scraping a hornpipe on
his violin half a mile off; and thus won by the lyre
of our sable Orpheus, the seals with their hairy
paws (usually known as flippers), their round black
heads, soft gleaming eyes, and spotted skins, from
which the brine was dripping, began to appear in
herds from subtle holes in the ice&mdash;holes through
which I was frequently in terror of vanishing from
mortal ken; and as these strange amphibious animals
rolled upon the field, turning up their full round
bellies, which reminded me of those of gorged swine,
I could see their bodies steaming in the frosty
sunshine, for being warm-blooded they emit at times a
vapour.
</p>

<p>
Seated on a sledge, under the lee of a hummock,
Cuffy played vigorously; but how his black fingers
could handle his instrument in such an atmosphere
was beyond my comprehension, for though the glare
of the noonday sun, as he shone through a cloudless
sky, was almost blinding, the degree of cold was
indescribable.  Ere long Snowball had a numerous
auditory, for music allures and fascinates these
animals, as it does many others; we are told how
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Rude Heiskar's seal through surges dark,<br />
  Will long pursue the minstrel's bark;"<br />
</p>

<p class="noindent">
but the moment our treacherous musician replaced
his violin in its canvas bag, an appalling scene of
butchery began.
</p>

<p>
The batmen rushed about as if a frenzy had
seized them, striking the seals on their round
bullet-like heads, knocking them over, stunned and
motionless.  Others followed, with long sharp knives,
by <i>five</i> slashes of which the expert hunter will denude
the largest cub of his smooth glossy skin, to which
the thick white fat adheres, and after being thus
denuded, on more than one occasion I have seen the
miserable animal, bared to its slender ribs, when
stung, as it were, by the intense frost reaching its
vitals, revive for a minute, and make efforts to crawl
along the ice, or drop into the sea!
</p>

<p>
The whole ice-field, which a moment before had
been so white in its spotless and untrodden purity,
now, within the radius of a mile, presented the
aspect of a battle-field, strewn with gashed carcases
and heaps of bloody skins that were steaming in the
sunshine.  Cuffy seemed in his element&mdash;in his glory!
Flourishing his long knife, he uttered yells as if
every seal he stripped had been the Chenoo wife who
sold him into slavery, or the Yankee taskmaster
whose whip had skinned <i>him</i> more than once.
</p>

<p>
This wholesale butchery sickened me.
</p>

<p>
The attachment of the mother-seal to her offspring
is very great; and here I saw a great hooded
one carrying off a little wounded cub in her mouth
toward the edge of the ice-field, where they dropped
into the sea, escaping Cuffy, who pursued them.
There are times when the mother turns fiercely with
tusks and claws upon the destroyers of her young,
and then the long gun with its charge of slugs is
brought into action; for on the <i>old</i> seals (Buffon
avers that some of them live for more than a
hundred years) the sturdiest batman's arm would swing
the knotted club in vain.  The membrane of the
hooded seal can be drawn over the nose, and
inflated, so as to protect the head like a helmet of
gutta-percha.
</p>

<p>
Leaving our people engaged in the work of
slaughter, halloing, shouting, and encouraging each
other, as they threw their bloody and greasy spoil
upon little sledges, to be dragged by ropes alongside
the brig, I proceeded over the hummocks in search
of&mdash;I scarcely knew what.
</p>

<p>
Our men seldom fired their guns, as shot destroys
the skin, which, after the cargo is brought into
port, has the fat or blubber carefully removed and
placed in the great wooden tanks or vats of the
oil-merchant; while the pelts are cleaned, spread, and,
after having layers of coarse salt placed between them,
are packed in bales for transport to other countries.
</p>

<p><a id="chap11"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XI.
<br /><br />
COMBAT WITH A SEA-HORSE.
</h3>

<p>
We continued to fish, or rather to hunt, the seals
here with considerable success, warping the brig
from day to day along the outer edge of the ice,
between which and her side we placed strong and soft
fenders; and the satisfaction of Hartly and his crew
increased in proportion as the piles of pelt and
blubber replaced in the hold the stone ballast which
we had brought from the island of Newfoundland.
</p>

<p>
I had shot a few refractory seals, but one evening,
when the atmosphere was singularly clear, I
rambled far along the ice-field, floundering and
scrambling among the hummocks, in the hope of
finding worthier game.  I was accompanied by one
of the crew, a smart and intelligent lad from North
Shields, named Ridly, who was armed only with an
ice-gaff.
</p>

<p>
One who has been among the countless waves
and ridges of a frozen sea can alone have an idea of
the toil of travelling, even for a mile, on an ice-field.
</p>

<p>
But on this vast floating waste we failed to
discern anything worth powder and shot, and so, worn
with our fruitless and desultory hunt, after
wandering about for an hour or two, we turned our
steps towards the brig, which still lay at anchor
by the edge of the field, about three miles off, and
the masts and yards of which formed the chief and
sole feature in the flat and dreary prospect.
</p>

<p>
The sun had set, but there was a dusky red flush
in the sky which marked the place of his declension;
and now the ice began to assume the cold green
tints of salt water when frozen, as the shadows of
night stole over the sky from the eastward like a
crape mantle, and one by one the stars came out in
the deep blue dome above us.
</p>

<p>
Sliding, toiling, and scrambling on, we were
endeavouring to reach the brig, when suddenly Ridly
and I uttered a mutual exclamation of alarm, paused,
and shrunk back.
</p>

<p>
In our front we heard an astounding roar, as of
an earthquake, and lo! between us and the
brig&mdash;between us and our friends, our home upon the
waters&mdash;there yawned a mighty fissure of zigzag
form, that ran east and west, and was about fifteen
or twenty feet wide, as the ice-field split under the
influence of some atmospheric change!
</p>

<p>
We stood and gazed blankly into each other's
faces on beholding this terrible barrier to our
progression, and fearing that the ice might yawn as
suddenly under our feet.
</p>

<p>
"Separated from all succour from the ship&mdash;alone
upon the ice, and with night coming on,
what will become of us?" said I, thinking aloud.
</p>

<p>
"God only knows, sir," responded my companion;
"but we must endeavour to reach the brig somehow."
</p>

<p>
"There goes a lantern up to her mainmast-head,"
said I, as a light was hoisted swiftly by the ensign
halliards.
</p>

<p>
"The captain is showing a signal to indicate her
whereabouts.  He has heard the noise of the splitting
ice."
</p>

<p>
"If a fog should come on!" said I.
</p>

<p>
"Don't think of it, sir," said my companion,
hastily; "the night is as clear as if day were overhead.
So let us find the end of this crack; it cannot
be very far off."
</p>

<p>
We proceeded westward for more than a mile,
being compelled to make many detours to avoid
falling into the water among the ragged floes or
pieces of ice that lay along the margin of this
zigzag fissure; but, as it extended far away beyond
the range of our vision, and seemed to widen, we were
compelled after long consideration, and suffering
great anxiety, to retrace our steps and proceed
eastward, in the hope of gaining the <i>east end</i> of it, or
at least of discovering a place so narrow that we
might leap across without the danger of immersion,
which, in such a season and at such an hour, would
have been fatal, as our entire clothing would in an
instant have become a casing of ice.
</p>

<p>
To favour our efforts the moon now rose, ascending
slowly from the edge of the vast plain of ice,
and notwithstanding the peril of our situation, her
beauty filled me with a glow of pleasure and
hope.
</p>

<p>
Far over that waste&mdash;so wide, so desolate, and
mysterious&mdash;fell her flood of silver light, so bright
in its intensity, and redoubled by reflection from
the snow.  It glittered on every rounded hummock
and splintered berg, and formed strange fantastic
figures in their cold green shadows, elsewhere
making prisms that seemed like fairy crystals, or
gemwork of rubies, emeralds, and silver.  Clouds of
fleecy whiteness came up with her from the sea, and
as she <i>waded</i> among them, I recalled the words of
Sir Walter Scott:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"There is something peculiarly pleasing to the
imagination in contemplating the Queen of Night
when she is wading, as the expression is, among the
vapours which she has not the power to dispel,
and which on their side are unable entirely to
quench her lustre.  It is the striking image of
patient virtue calmly pursuing her path through
good report and bad report, having that excellence
in herself which ought to command all admiration;
but bedimmed in the eyes of the world by suffering,
by misfortune, and by calumny."
</p>

<p>
While I felt something of the poetry of our
situation and the beauty of the night, my more
practical and prosaic companion was sensible only
of the danger we ran, and after a minute
reconnaissance, assured me, with an exclamation of joy,
that the split in the ice was narrowing.
</p>

<p>
We were then four miles from the brig, the crew
of which had sent more lanterns aloft, and ever and
anon burned a brilliant red or blue light, for Cuffy
Snowball was a great pyrotechnist.
</p>

<p>
"What is that?" said I, as a strange sound
reached us.
</p>

<p>
"I cannot tell," replied my comrade, as he toiled
on, supporting himself with his ice-gaff; "I never
heard it before, and don't like it at all, sir.  I wish
we were on board," he added, shuddering alike with
cold and superstitious fear, as the sound came again
and again from among the hummocks, and it was as
weird and mournful to the ear as their aspect was
to the eye.
</p>

<p>
It was a strange <i>mooing</i>, and gradually swelled
into a bellowing as we proceeded; thus it evidently
came from the throat of a large animal&mdash;but what
species of animal could it be in such a place?
</p>

<p>
We were not left long in doubt, for on the centre
of a narrow isthmus of ice, <i>over which lay our way to
the ship</i>, as the fissure beyond it opened wider than
elsewhere, sat a huge, dark monster of the deep,
in which, on approaching it, I recognised (from
pictures I had seen) a sea-horse, or walrus, which
the reader must remember is <i>not</i> a seal, but a
ferocious animal that can defend itself and frequently
destroys its assailants, and this one manifested not
the slightest intention of making way for us.
</p>

<p>
He was fearfully pre-Adamite, or antediluvian, in
his proportions, being fully twenty feet in length,
and having a pair of tusks thirty inches long
protruding from the mass of quill-like bristles which
covered (like a thick moustache and whiskers) his
upper lips and cheeks.  Grimly and ferociously he
regarded us with his deep-set eyes, which glittered
in the moonlight amid the square mass of his
elephantine visage, and on beholding us, his hollow
mooing turned into a species of grunting bark.
</p>

<p>
Finding that he obstinately barred our way, and,
moreover, seemed inclined to attack us, I levelled
my rifle full at his grizzly front and fired, while
Ridly rashly and fatally charged him in the smoke
with his ice-gaff, which was armed with a sharp pike.
</p>

<p>
My ball had pierced his great sloping shoulder,
pricking him as a pin might have done, and serving
only to incense him, for his bark changed to a
mighty roar, and when the smoke cleared away, I
saw poor Ridly, who had fallen, lying under one of
his gigantic fore-flippers.  The foam of rage was
frothing on the bristles of the sea-horse, and with
his two enormous tusks, which stood upward through
them like two crooked sabre-blades, he was alternately
rending the limbs and body of his assailant
and then great fragments of ice, which he dashed
into the water on each side of him.
</p>

<p>
Ridly had only power to utter a faint cry, when
he expired.
</p>

<p>
Appalled by this sudden and terrible catastrophe,
I reloaded my rifle, and full of mingled rage and
fear&mdash;a combination which made me no longer feel
the intensity of the cold&mdash;I fired again and again at
the horrid front of the walrus; but every shot
seemed only to redouble his wrath, and he continued
to rend to pieces the clothes and body of Ridly,
till in less than five minutes the ice around him was
covered by the blood of his victim and that which
gushed from his own wounds.  Ridly's left leg he
wrenched completely off, and cast into the sea.
</p>

<p>
Rolling about in his wrath, and in his lubberly
efforts to reach me, he at last fell into the water;
I then rushed across the narrow isthmus where my
poor companion lay.  As I did so, the walrus made
many ineffectual efforts to reach me, grasping the
ice with his forepaws, or dashing his vast shoulders
madly against it, while he plunged and bellowed
and covered all the water in the chasm around him
with mingled blood and foam, and, in his impotent
fury, tore great blocks off the ice by the tusks of
his lower jaw.
</p>

<p>
I fired ten shots into his body, point blank,
without his strength or wrath appearing to
diminish in the least.
</p>

<p>
On perceiving this, a species of superstitious
dread came over me, and turning away, I hastened
towards the brig, which, as I have stated, lay about
four miles distant, leaving my walrus to flounder,
bellow, and drown in the moonlight.
</p>

<p>
Anxiety to reach the vessel, lest I might be
overcome by fatigue, or that fatal drowsiness caused at
times by intense cold, made me strain every
energy; and thus in a much shorter time than
could have deemed possible, considering the alternately
rough or slippery and laborious nature of the
ice-field to be traversed, I found myself among the
carcasses of our slaughtered seals, and within hail of
the <i>Leda</i>.
</p>

<p>
Furnished with ice-gaffs, a bottle of rum, a sledge,
and plenty of blankets, so as to be prepared for any
emergency, Captain Hartly, with Hans Peterkin
and ten of the crew, met me, just as I was sinking
with fatigue, half sleepy and half delirious with
cold.  Thus a considerable time elapsed ere I could
relate the story of my adventure and our shipmate's
death.
</p>

<p>
They had heard the roar of the splitting ice, and
knew why we were wandering so long and so
deviously among the hummocks, but the sound of
firing puzzled them extremely; and thus, while
Paul Reeves with a gang was hoisting out the
jolly-boat upon a sledge, to have it launched in the
chasm for our conveyance across, Hartly had come
on in advance, and he met me just in time, for in
ten minutes more I must have perished of fatigue
and cold!
</p>

<p>
On returning next morning to collect poor
Ridly's remains and commit them to the deep, we
found his great destroyer dead, but floating by the
margin of the ice, to which he was literally anchored,
or hooked, by his two longest tusks.
</p>

<p>
By this, and the affair with the <i>Black Schooner</i>,
we had lost two of our crew.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XII.
<br /><br />
ON AN ICEBERG.
</h3>

<p>
Soon after this, in a dark and howling night, we
were blown from our moorings, and forced to run
before the wind, with our topmasts struck, and only
our jib and a close-reefed foresail set, as we were in
the dangerous vicinity of innumerable broken floes,
or masses detached from the field-ice: the decks
were so slippery that one could scarcely keep afoot;
and amid the arrowy sleet and snow that rendered
all so murky and obscure around us, and which
stung the face like showers of sharp needles, we
were hurried on, expecting every moment a collision
which would stave our bows or snap the masts by
the board.
</p>

<p>
We were repeatedly frost-bitten in the ears, nose,
or hands; but snow scraped up in the scuppers and
promptly applied, soon brought a hot glow in the
benumbed member, and proved our best, indeed our
only remedy.
</p>

<p>
All who could cultivate beards had permitted
them to grow in Crimean luxuriance, as any attempt
at soapsudding in those latitudes produced a
coating of ice in a moment.
</p>

<p>
Surging on through blinding drift and pitchy
darkness, amid the howling of the fierce tempest,
the <i>Leda</i> went bravely!  Her spars and cordage
straining and groaning, her timbers creaking, while
wave after wave broke over her decks and hardy
crew, each leaving its legacy of ice upon everything.
From time to time we were conscious of a rude
shock, or a furious scraping sound, as she grazed
upon the passing floes; and now, to add to the
gloomy horrors of that tempestuous night, Paul
Reeves, who was keeping an anxious look-out
forward, shouted back through his trumpet&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Icebergs ahead!  Hard to port, or we are foul
of one!"
</p>

<p>
"Hard to port," echoed the two men at the
wheel; sharply it revolved, and in a moment we
swept under the frowning cliff of a stupendous
iceberg, the cold white mass of which was
discernible through the gloom, as the arm of the
mainyard grazed it!
</p>

<p>
We passed on and it vanished in the darkness
astern.
</p>

<p>
"Thank Heaven!"
</p>

<p>
"Thank God!"
</p>

<p>
"A narrow escape!"
</p>

<p>
Such were the muttered exclamations of our half-frozen
crew; but at that instant an icy sea broke
over us, and two men were swept into a watery
grave, without the possibility of our rendering them
the least assistance.
</p>

<p>
A minute had scarcely elapsed before we were
sensible of a fierce concussion; the masts reeled and
the icicles fell in a shower as they were shaken
from our stiffened top-hamper.  Then the brig's
head was tilted up and her stern correspondingly
depressed; but still impelled by the fury of the
wind, she continued to advance upwards and <i>out of
the water</i>, as if she was being steamed up a
landing-slip, or into a dry dock.
</p>

<p>
"We are ashore&mdash;beached!" said some one,
beholding this phenomenon.
</p>

<p>
"We are foul of an iceberg," exclaimed Hartly,
while the brig continued slowly to ascend till little
more than the sternpost and counter were in the
water; then she heeled over to port and remained
there, wedged, with her jib-boom broken off at the
cap, and dangling in the jib-guys, her canvas
bellying out so furiously that we thought the masts
would be carried away before the benumbed fingers
of the seamen could get it handed.
</p>

<p>
In a trice the <i>Leda</i> was under bare poles, while
around us the tempestuous wind was bellowing, the
surf was roaring, and vast blocks of ice, many tons
in weight, were crashing against each other, adding
to the dread horrors of this bewildering catastrophe!
</p>

<p>
It is impossible to depict the dismay of all on
board, when finding the vessel in this situation&mdash;high
and dry upon a berg; for, influenced by the
storm, by the wind, or the slight additional weight of
the brig and her cargo, we felt the monstrous mass
on which we were wedged, <i>oscillating</i> and gradually
heeling forward ahead; thus the stern of the
<i>Leda</i> was raised until her hull remained in the
air horizontally, just as she usually sat in the
water.
</p>

<p>
In blank horror we endured the gloomy hours of
that northern night, amid the drift, the sleet, and a
darkness so dense that we could in no way discover
our real position, or how to extricate ourselves
from it.
</p>

<p>
One fact, we were alarmingly alive to.  It was
this:&mdash;The sea no longer dashed against the hull
of our vessel, which lay on her side, well careened over
to port; and though we could <i>hear</i> the roaring of
the waves, amid the oppressive gloom that enveloped
us, we could no longer <i>see</i> them.
</p>

<p>
As day broke the tempest gradually lulled, and
the sleet, the snow, and wind passed away together.
Then the increasing light enabled us to see the
perils of our situation.
</p>

<p>
We were nearly eighty feet above the ocean, on
the flat, table-like summit of a mighty iceberg;
which, though it had presented a sloping face <i>up</i>
which we had run last night before the furious
wind and sea, had now changed its position by
heeling over, as icebergs always do, from time to
time, when their base in the ocean becomes
honeycombed and decayed.*
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="footnote">
* Her Majesty's steam ship <i>Intrepid</i>, when commanded by
Captain Cator, was similarly carried bodily up the face of a
berg, and left high and dry in air, without injury.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
The sky was clear now to the horizon; the
icefield on which we had pursued our hunting so
successfully was no longer visible; but about half
a mile distant lay the island of floating ice we had
escaped last night; and around for miles, far as
the eye could reach, the sea, still perturbed by
the past storm, was flecked by white floes, the
ruins probably of a third berg, which had been
shattered by the waves or by being dashed against
others.
</p>

<p>
Both these icebergs were several miles in
circumference.  The summit of ours was flat as a
bowling-green; but that portion on which the brig
rested was soft, pulpy, and rotten by its long
immersion in the sea.
</p>

<p>
The other had many spiral pinnacles, some of
them being several hundred feet in height; and,
save for the peril in which we were situated, I could
have admired the sublimity of that cold and silent
mass&mdash;so dazzlingly white when the beams of the
rising sun fell on it, so indigo-blue in its shadows&mdash;for
it resembled a fairy isle, which had steep hills,
deep valleys, and chasms all fashioned of alabaster;
while around its base was a thick fringe of frozen
foam of snowy brilliance.
</p>

<p>
While we were gazing upon it that morning, one
of its loftiest pinnacles, with a mighty crash, fell
thundering into the sea.
</p>

<p>
The <i>Leda</i> was soon frozen into the bed she had
ploughed by her keel in the ice; and <i>how</i> to get her
launched again, <i>how</i> to descend from our perilous
eminence, were the questions we asked of each
other, and which no one could answer.
</p>

<p>
The summit of the berg was nearly a mile in
circumference, and, as I have said, was more than
eighty feet from the water.  This we ascertained as
a fact, though there was no small peril in venturing
from the ship upon its surface, which was so glassy
and smooth that in some places the lightest among
us would have slipped off, as if shot by a catapulta,
into the sea below.
</p>

<p>
Council and deliberation availed us nothing.
Even Hartly, Reeves, and Hans, with all their united
skill, foresight, and seamanship, found their
invention fail in suggesting any means of release.
</p>

<p>
"There is nothing for it but to wait the event,"
said Hartly, after a long and solemn council.
</p>

<p>
"But suppose that we waited a month, captain,"
asked Reeves, gloomily, "where would our provisions
be?&mdash;where our fresh water?"
</p>

<p>
"We may be driven south into warmer latitudes
where the bergs melt rapidly in the sunshine."
</p>

<p>
"But we may be drifted north into latitudes
where the bergs freeze harder, and where ice may
close around us for ever," said Hans Peterkin.
</p>

<p>
"Or," said one of the seamen, who all crowded
anxiously to this conference, which we held around
the capstan-head, "the berg may <i>capsize</i>, and
what will become of us then?"
</p>

<p>
"Hold hard, my lads," exclaimed Hartly, "hold
hard, and be stout of heart and cheery.  Remember
that however miserable we may deem ourselves,
there is one Blessed Eye upon us&mdash;the eye of a
kind, good God," he added, uncovering his head
reverently to the bitter frost, "One who will never
forget the poor sailor, if he is true to himself.
Think of the 'sweet little cherub that sits up aloft,'
as the song says, and rail not at fate, for fate guides
man neither at home nor abroad, at sea or on shore.
Put all your trust aloft, my boys, and hold on by
poor Jack's best bower anchor!"
</p>

<p>
This harangue was exactly suited to his hearers.
We tried to feel hopeful and trusting, and to have
patience.  But we longed very much, nevertheless,
to be free of the iceberg, and to have the blue sea
dashing alongside once more.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap13"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XIII.
<br /><br />
ON THE ICEBERG&mdash;THE MASSACRE AT HIERRO.
</h3>

<p>
In this appalling situation we remained for ten days
before any alteration in the position either of the
brig or of the two icebergs was perceptible.
</p>

<p>
We missed our lost companions sorely, for the
death of a shipmate in his hammock, or by falling
overboard, makes a great impression on the secluded
survivors at sea.  His watery grave is in itself a
fearful mystery, the depth of which we cannot
realize or fathom.  No stone or mound marks the
place where he lies; he is hurled, as it were, soul
and body into eternity, and blotted out of existence
like the bubbles that break round the place where
he sinks.
</p>

<p>
During these ten days Hartly was indefatigable
in his efforts to keep his crew employed, and their
spirits from depression.  Lest provisions might
become scarce, and our water fall short, he had
portions of the seals, the hideous paws especially,
cleaned, prepared, and pickled, while the snow and
ice which adhered to the rigging was boiled down,
and added to our supply of fresh water.  To save
our fuel, the fire for these purposes was fed with the
fat of the seals, and the blubber (so long as it lasted)
of the gigantic walrus I had slain.
</p>

<p>
The seal "flippers," hairy and bloody, like the
claws of a baboon hewn off at the wrist, made a very
cannibal-like repast when fricasseed.  Remembering
how I had shuddered on seeing such repulsive
carrion sold at a penny per bunch in the streets of
St. John, I could scarcely digest such a meal; though
Cuffy Snowball, when he made them into sea-pies,
rolled his eyes and grinned from ear to ear while
declaring his handiwork "de berry best dish in de
'varsal creation!"
</p>

<p>
Our rigging was carefully inspected and prepared
for any emergency, as if we expected to make sail
on the brig at a moment's notice; but <i>how</i> was she
ever to reach her natural element again?
</p>

<p>
On this subject, though we were wearied of it,
conjecture became utterly <i>lost</i>!
</p>

<p>
Still, like a brave fellow, Hartly left nothing
unsaid or undone to keep up our hopes, though his
own sank at times.  Save the watch on deck, he
nightly assembled all hands in the cabin for
companionship and also for warmth.  There he sang
songs, (while Cuffy accompanied him on the violin,)
and told stories, or read aloud, and spoke again and
again to the poor crest-fallen seal-fishers (who
thought only of their wives and families) of their
profits on the voyage, and the reward they would
receive from the Governor of Newfoundland for
destroying the obnoxious <i>Black Schooner</i>; and of that
affair he drew up a statement, to be attested by all
on board.
</p>

<p>
His example was invaluable, for he had somehow
acquired the greatest influence over all his crew.  "It
is pleasing to see a family, a farm, or establishment of
any kind (says Lorimer, in his "Letters to a Young
Merchant-Mariner") when, from long servitude, the
assistants and domestics are considered as humble
friends or distant relations; and independently of
the kind feelings thereby occasioned and cherished,
all seems to prosper with them.  Such a state of
things is by no means unfrequent in this happy
country, Britain; and I see no good reason why the
same attachment to the master and to each other,
should not be more frequent on shipboard; indeed,
considering the dangers they are continually sharing,
one is almost surprised that they can <i>separate</i> so
readily.  How to obtain a kind but powerful
influence over, and a devoted attachment <i>from</i>, a crew,
is a secret worth our deep consideration;" and
Robert Hartly eminently possessed this secret,
which, in the desperation of our circumstances,
proved a priceless gift to him and to us.
</p>

<p>
Every night one story or yarn produced others,
and so the time passed on, and peril was half
forgotten.
</p>

<p>
Most of these narratives were gloomy enough,
however.  They told of ships whose crews were all
poisoned save one man, by partaking of a mysterious
fish, or whose crews turned pirates, and slaughtered
all who opposed them; or of men who were marooned
on lonely isles, and left to perish miserably.
</p>

<p>
Hans Peterkin, an Orkneyman, could tell us of
queer shadowy craft, manned by spectres, demons,
and evil spirits, who displayed lights to lure vessels
ashore on Cape Wrath and the rocks of Ultima
Thule, like the wreckers of Cornwall and Brittany.
</p>

<p>
Then Paul Reeves matched them by a curious
tale of an enchanted island in the Indian Seas, on
which the lights of churches and houses could be
seen at night, and where the tolling of bells and
the song of vespers could be heard, with many
other sounds; but lo! as the ship approached, the
isle would seem to recede till it sank into the sea
and reappeared <i>astern</i>!
</p>

<p>
Then Tom Hammer, the carpenter, gave us a
yarn of an ice-cliff in Hudson's Bay that long
overhung a whaler he was once serving in.  One day
the cliff was changed in form, for a mighty piece
had fallen from it into the sea; and wonderful to
relate, there was seen a man's figure among the
ice&mdash;a man imbedded up there a hundred feet above
the sea.  Telescopes were at once in requisition,
and they made out that he was frozen&mdash;dead&mdash;hard
and fast; but by his dress&mdash;a red doublet, trunk-hose,
and a long black beard&mdash;they supposed he was
some ancient mariner; and some there were on board
who vowed he was no other than the famous
voyager Hendrick Hudson, who discovered the bay,
and was marooned by his mutinous crew in 1610.
</p>

<p>
But one night, when we were all nestling close
together, muffled in our pea-jackets, and smoking, to
promote warmth, a narration of Hartly's far exceeded
all that preceded it in interest, being a veritable
occurrence, and by its barbarity singular.
</p>

<p>
"My grandfather," said he, "as thoroughbred an
old salt as ever faced a stiff topsail breeze, was
skipper of the <i>Dublin</i>, a smart little ship of three
hundred and fifty tons, pierced for twelve
six-pounders, being a letter of marque that fought her
own way when the way upon the high seas was
somewhat more perilous than it is now.
</p>

<p>
"About the autumn of the year 1784&mdash;now a
long time ago, my lads&mdash;she was chartered as an
emigrant ship for Canada, and sailed from the
Mersey with one hundred and eighty poor folks,
half of whom were women and children, going to
seek their bread in another laud; and a troublesome
voyage the old gentleman had with them, for foul
weather came on; many of his spars were knocked
away, and then a heavy sickness broke out among
the emigrants.  Their little ones died daily and were
hove overboard, till those whose children survived
became wild with fear and apprehension that theirs
would follow next; and, to make matters worse,
there was no doctor on board; for this was in 1784,
as I told you, and the lives of the poor were not
worth much to any one, save themselves, in those
old times.
</p>

<p>
"Well, my grandfather was a soft-hearted old
fellow, and his heart bled for the poor people.  His
sick bay was crammed, and the sailmaker's needle
was never idle, but made one little shroud after
another till the man's heart sickened of the dreary
task.  So, when foul weather mastered the <i>Dublin</i>,
and blew her out of her course, the old gentleman
put his helm a-lee and bore up for the Canaries,
which were once called the Fortunate Isles, and
came in sight of Hierro, the most westerly of these
islands, on the 6th December, 1784.  He had his
ensign flying; but knowing well what slippery devils
the Spaniards are, and that the <i>Dublin</i> had rather a
man-o'-war cut in her spars and bends, he hoisted a
<i>white</i> flag at his foremast head, and so came peacefully
to anchor about sunrise.
</p>

<p>
"The morning was beautiful; the shore was
desolate, but fertile and green.  The poor emigrants
were mad with joy at the sight of land, and in an
hour or two he set them all ashore, about a hundred
in number, on the smooth sandy beach.  Many of
them were women with infants in their arms or at
their skirts&mdash;men supporting their young wives or
old parents; and new life and health seemed returning
to them as they rambled on the sunny shore, or
drank of the pure springs that gushed from the
rocks, and as they pulled the green leaves and
aromatic flowers, or the broad plantain leaves which
always flourish best near the sea.
</p>

<p>
"Meanwhile, my grandfather had triced up his
portlids, and a gang with buckets and swabs were
busy cleaning, airing, and fumigating every place
fore and aft, ere the live cargo were shipped again
at night, when an unforeseen catastrophe took
place&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"A catastrophe!" said I; "the ship was blown
out to sea?"
</p>

<p>
"Not at all," said Hartly, refilling his pipe.
</p>

<p>
"What then?"
</p>

<p>
"His poor people were all dead ere nightfall."
</p>

<p>
"Murdered?"
</p>

<p>
"Aye, in cold blood, as you shall hear.  They
were all enjoying themselves&mdash;the children were
playing, gambolling and tumbling over each other
in heaps on the warm sands; the women were busy
washing, dressing and arranging each other's hair;
the men smoking their pipes, and talking, perhaps
regretfully, of that jolly old England they had left
for ever and, it might be hopefully, of the new shores
they were bound for, when a long line of bright
bayonets that glittered ominously in the sunshine,
appeared suddenly upon the steep rocks which
completely enclosed the sandy cove, and three companies
of lubberly Spanish militia commanded by Don Juan
Briez de Calderon, encircled them on all sides, save
towards the sea, where the <i>Dublin</i> lay at anchor
about three-quarters of a mile off.  The reason of
this military display I shall explain.
</p>

<p>
"False rumours of a plague said to be raging in
Europe had reached these isles, and filled the selfish
and superstitious Spanish colonists with such alarm,
that Señor the Governor, fearing, or pretending to
fear, the strangers might bring it among them,
instantly convened la Mesa del Consejo&mdash;his council-board,
as they call it in their lingo&mdash;and quietly
proposed to cut off all these voyagers root and
branch!
</p>

<p>
"Some of the councillors vigorously opposed a
course so revolting, and pled the cause of the poor
Inglesos, the rights of religion and humanity, and
called upon Don Juan to remember the honour of
the king he represented, and that he was the lineal
descendant of that adventurous Don Diego de Hierro,
of Old Castile, who had captured the island in the
days of Ferdinand the Catholic, King of Arragon,
bestowing in memory thereof his own illustrious
name upon it, and so forth.
</p>

<p>
"Señor Don Juan did not reply, but knit his
fierce black brows, lighted a cigar, and puffed away
with true Castilian imperturbability.
</p>

<p>
"'Señor el Gobernador,' urged a venerable Spanish
friar, 'these poor people who have landed on our
shores, after a long voyage apparently, we know not
from whence, have been forced hither, as our
mariners aver, by those recent storms which have
swept over the Canary Isles&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
"'What is all this to me?' growled Don Juan.
</p>

<p>
"'Simply, Señor, that it will be alike cruel and
unjust to inflict the penalty of death upon them all
for this.'
</p>

<p>
"'Padre, they have transgressed the laws of
Hierro,' thundered the Governor.
</p>

<p>
"'Laws temporarily made by <i>yourself</i>&mdash;laws with
which they can in no way be acquainted.  If they
have sickness among them, let us send tents and
supplies; but guard the avenues to the ground we
may allot them, until they are all re-embarked with
their wives and little ones.  I will myself go among
them,' continued the old friar, warming in his
merciful advocacy, 'and say that you will graciously
afford them succour, until the orders of the most
illustrious señor, our Governor-General at Teneriffe,
can be obtained.'
</p>

<p>
"'<i>Silencio!</i>' thundered Don Juan, and rudely
threw the remains of his cigar in the old man's face;
'order out our troops&mdash;we shall march instantly and
exterminate these dangerous vermin!'
</p>

<p>
"The drums were beat, and the militia, three
hundred strong, with the valiant Don Juan at their
head, marched to where the poor visitors, ignorant
of the horrors that were impending, were still
amusing themselves upon the beach.  Some were
gathering the brilliant shells, flowers, and leaves;
others were filling little kegs and jars with the pure
spring water that poured over the ledges of rock.
The women were sitting in groups, with their
children gambolling about them; others were gazing
sadly on the evening sea, as if calculating the
number of miles that lay between them and their
old home; or the miles they had yet to traverse
ere they found a new one amid the forests of the
western world.
</p>

<p>
"To gather them all together, the villanous
Briez de Calderon procured an empty sugar puncheon,
and tossed it over the summit of the cliffs on
which his men were posted.  From thence, with a
loud noise, it rolled to the beach below.  Curiosity
made all the loiterers rush towards it, as many of
them thought it contained food, clothes, or other
necessaries for them.  The men gave a hurrah, and
waved their hats in hearty English jollity to the
crafty Spaniards, and gathered with the women and
children around the puncheon.
</p>

<p>
"'Fire!' cried Don Juan.
</p>

<p>
"Savage as they were, the Spaniards paused a
moment; but Don Juan was the first to fire a
musket, and observing that his men were still
reluctant, he knocked one down with the butt-end,
and threatened the rest with death if they disobeyed
him.
</p>

<p>
"'Fire!' he shouted again, and then on the
unsuspecting crowd there was poured the concentrated
volley of these three hundred miscreants; thus, in
ten minutes the dreadful massacre was complete.
On the beach all were lying dead and drenched in
blood&mdash;husband and wife, parent and child&mdash;all save
one woman, who, with her infant, concealed herself
in the rocks, and her husband, who, with a ball
lodged in his arm, sprang into the sea and
endeavoured to swim to the ship.
</p>

<p>
"Failing in this, faint with loss of blood, weary
and despairing, he turned about and sought the
shore, where he was hewn to pieces by sabres as he
clung to a seaweedy rock.  On beholding this dreadful
sight, his poor wife, who was concealed in a cleft
of the cliffs not far off, uttered a shriek of dismay,
which drew the murderers, now flushed with blood,
towards her.
</p>

<p>
"She was soon dragged out, and with his own
dagger Don Juan stabbed her to the heart, and then
killed the child, which he tossed into the sea beside
its father!
</p>

<p>
"Paralysed by rage and astonishment, my grandfather
and his crew saw all this from the deck of the
<i>Dublin</i>.  They could see the red musketry flashing
from the rocks, filling all the little cove with
slaughtered corpses and smoke.  They could hear the
shrieks that were borne over the water on the
evening wind; and after a time, when all was still,
they could see the beach strewn with dead bodies,
and in possession of the Spaniards, who were stripping
them, and who brought up field-pieces to fire
on the <i>Dublin</i>.
</p>

<p>
"He hoisted his anchor and bore away; but on
coming abreast of the capital with British colours
flying <i>above</i> the Spanish ensign <i>reversed</i>, he pitched
a few shot into it from his carronades, sunk three
craft at their anchors, with all their crews on board,
and then bore away for England, and there was an
end of it.  We were at peace with Spain; but I
never heard that satisfaction was given, or the
atrocity revenged.  That is <i>my</i> yarn, lads."*
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="footnote">
* The papers of the time fully corroborate Hartly's story.
"The news of this barbarity," says the Annual Register for
1785, "has been received at Teneriffe by all ranks of people
with the deepest concern and regret, and by none more than
the Governor-General, who deplores it extremely.  He could
not at first give credit to it; but was at last convinced of the
fatal truth, by letters from the wretch Briez de Calderon
himself.  Exasperated to the highest pitch, he has given a
commission to an officer of rank to go over to Hierro to take
cognizance of this tragical affair,"&mdash;of which we hear no
more.

<h3>
CHAPTER XIV.
<br /><br />
ESCAPE FROM THE ICEBEBG.
</h3>

<p>
Though our apprehensions were great, our chief
sufferings were from cold in that lofty and listless
situation; yet our dread of impending dangers was
so keen, our hope of a change so great, that even
the oldest seamen on board never turned into their
berths or bunks at night but with their clothes on,
"to be ready," as they said, "to turn up with all
standing at a moment's notice."
</p>

<p>
Hartly, who was rather scientific and was wont to
expatiate upon the theory of storms, and so forth,
endeavoured to account for the intensity of the frost,
which I deemed a somewhat unnecessary illustration
to us who were on the summit of an iceberg.
</p>

<p>
"The thermometer&mdash;" he would begin.
</p>

<p>
"Ugh! don't speak of the thermometer, Bob,"
said I, one day, when trembling in every fibre, as we
endeavoured to tread to and fro on the sloping deck.
"It is so cold now, that the atmosphere can never
be colder!"
</p>

<p>
"So you think; but wait until&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"When?"
</p>

<p>
"&mdash;we are a few degrees further north, perhaps in
the centre of an ice-field, and then you will know
what cold is!  But the <i>degree</i> of it depends upon
the power of the wind, after passing over
snow-covered wastes, rather than the actual state of the
mercury;&mdash;that was all I was about to remark."
</p>

<p>
I was too miserable to thank him for the information,
but said:
</p>

<p>
"I do not think our vicinity to that other
atrocious iceberg adds to the pleasantness of our
temperature."
</p>

<p>
"Of course not&mdash;but see," he added, raising his
voice, "by Heaven, it is oscillating!"
</p>

<p>
Just as he spoke, the cold, glistening, and
splintered peaks of the mighty berg seemed to topple
over and sink into the sea, as it <i>reversed</i> with a
stunning roar&mdash;its former base coming upward, and
imparting an entirely new form to it.
</p>

<p>
All on board stood gazing at this reversal, which
is a common occurrence with icebergs; but it
filled us with a horror of what <i>our</i> fate would be
should a similar capsize occur with us, for now the
berg on which we were wedged heaved and surged
in the foaming eddy made by the other.
</p>

<p>
"Icebergs have usually nine times as much of
them below water as appears above it," said I.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, and at that ratio, if this one of ours reversed,
we should find ourselves in a moment somewhere
about six hundred and forty feet below the surface of
the sea," replied Hartly, with a grim smile.
</p>

<p>
"Ay," added Paul Reeves, "and our poor little
<i>Leda</i> would be adhering, keel upmost and trucks
down, like a barnacle at the bottom of this vast
floating island."
</p>

<p>
On the tenth day of our imprisonment, as I have
elsewhere said, after rain had been falling all night
in such torrents that we had battened all the hatches
fore and aft, on day breaking, we found a very
perceptible alteration in the position of the brig.
From careening over to port, she had gradually
righted, and now rested fairly on her keel, with her
masts upright.  The summit of the berg had again
become soft and pulpy on its surface, and the <i>Leda</i>
seemed to sink lower by her own weight every
minute, while the ice on each side sloped upward,
leaving her in a kind of valley; and so rapidly did
this state of matters go on, that in four hours the
sides were nearly eight feet above our deck, and
suggested a new terror, that they might collapse&mdash;close
over, and freeze us in more hopelessly than ever.
</p>

<p>
As the rain abated, the berg began palpably to
oscillate, that portion of it which lay under the brig's
head, however, became depressed, and then the
rainwater and <i>sludge</i> that had collected in the valley
where we lay, poured over its icy brow like a cataract,
and we heard it thundering, as it fell into the sea
below.
</p>

<p>
"She moves&mdash;the brig moves! she forges ahead!"
exclaimed Hartly, in an excited voice, as the berg
careened over more and more, and we all stood pale,
breathless, speechless, and rooted to the deck,
expecting a capsize that would bury her masts
downward in the sea.
</p>

<p>
This change of position continued to progress, but
very slowly.
</p>

<p>
There were about sixteen feet of ice from the cutwater
of the <i>Leda</i> to the edge of the berg, and about
forty from her stern-post to the edge in the other
direction.
</p>

<p>
"If this depression forward continues slowly,"
said Hartly, "we shall be floating in the blue in two
hours, my lads; clear away two hawsers, an ice-anchor,
and kedge.  Stand by with the capstan-bars,
cast loose the jib and foretopsail, to lift her head a
bit, if the wind serves when she slips off, and then
stand by the braces to sheet home!"
</p>

<p>
These orders recalled us to life, for they filled us
with hope, and inspired us with activity.
</p>

<p>
Led by Hartly, Hans Peterkin and two other
adventurous fellows named Abbot clambered along the
soft ice astern, and fixed there a kedge with our
strongest hawser, which was to be eased gently off
the capstan, as the brig continued to forge
downward and a-head, for her motion was a double one.
It was perilous work for these four brave men, as the
rain had rendered the face of the berg slippery as
wetted glass; but Hartly was full of inherent
courage, and in the excitement of the moment forgot
all his superstition about his ring, the gift of the
reputed witch Jensdochter.
</p>

<p>
He was scarcely on board again, ere the depression
continued so rapidly that the entire hull of the brig
lay at an angle of forty-five degrees from the line of
the water below&mdash;her bows being yet twenty feet
distant from it.
</p>

<p>
This was a momentous crisis for us all!
</p>

<p>
A deathlike stillness was every where on board; on
our pale lips, as we grasped the shrouds or belaying
pins to preserve our footing; on the mighty isle of
ice, from the shelving summit of which we were about
to be precipitated; and from the lonely sea below,
there came no sound; at least, we heard only its
wavelets rippling against the cold, glistening, and
glacial sides of our prison.
</p>

<p>
Slowly the brig moved, as if to protract that time
of agonizing suspense.  Every man compressed his
lips and stifled his breathing.  We seemed to speak
our thoughts in silent and expressive glances, for all
had the certainty now that in <i>three</i> minutes more, we
should be floating on the free waters of the ocean, or
foundered and sunk, headforemost, far beneath them.
</p>

<p>
Foot by foot she forged ahead, as the berg
continued to heel over, and ere long our bowsprit
projected in the air over the edge, and then the bows,
headboards, and cutwater!  The angle at which the
<i>Leda</i> lay was fearful; we could no longer work the
capstan; I clasped it with my arms, and shut my
eyes.  Then a heavy sob seemed to escape from me,
as Reeves, by one slash with a sharp axe on the
taffrail, parted the stern warp, which recoiled with
a crack like a coach-whip.  Then followed a rushing
sound&mdash;a mighty plunge, and the waves dashed in
foam on each side of us, as the <i>Leda</i> shot off the
berg, and went souse, bows foremost into the sea;
but rising up again, and shaking all the spray off
her, as a duck would have done.
</p>

<p>
There was a deep silence after the shock and escape
of this launch, and all seemed to await the signal to
utter a hearty hurrah of joy and thankfulness for
our miraculous preservation.  Ere long it burst
forth, but Hartly cut it short by his orders to sheet
home the jib and foretopsail, to set the foresail, fore
and aft mainsail and maintopsail.
</p>

<p>
Rapidly he was obeyed, and just as the <i>Leda</i> fell
off, and bore away from the dangerous vicinity of
the ice-island, it capsized, as its companion had done,
and with a roar, as if defrauded of its prey.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap15"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XV
<br /><br />
UNDER WEIGH ONCE MORE.
</h3>

<p>
The chainbobstay under the bowsprit was snapped,
our rudder was split and its pintles were started, but
these defects were soon repaired by the carpenter;
and next day, at noon, Hartly and Reeves on
comparing their observations, discovered that, unknown
to ourselves, we had drifted nearly one hundred miles
towards the western coast of Greenland, so a look-out
was kept for the field-ice, as they were anxious
to complete their interrupted seal-fishing, to haul
up for St. John's, and then freight for Europe in the
spring.
</p>

<p>
Poor fellows! ...
</p>

<p>
We seemed to have returned to life once more.
Again we were dashing through the blue sea with a
free sheet, with the white canvas bellying full upon
the breeze; again, on waking in the morning, the
first familiar sounds that met the ear were the decks
undergoing their customary ablutions, by bucket and
swab, and the rasping holystones; Cuffy singing
some Congo melody as he lighted the cabin fire, the
wind whistling through the rigging, the patter of
the reef-points on the bosom of the swollen sails, the
dashing of the spray over the sharp black bows, the
occasional order issued on deck, the clatter of the
rudder in its case, and the bubble of the water as it
frothed past under the counter.
</p>

<p>
All these spoke of our wonted life of activity, and
of the <i>Leda</i> being under canvas.
</p>

<p>
In a day or two we descried the slender white line
of an ice-field, stretching for miles along the horizon
towards the north, and approached it under easy
sail, as the fields usually drift southward at this
season.  By the appearance of the ice and the state
of the thermometer, we concluded this to be a much
larger field than that from which we had been blown
by the gale of wind.
</p>

<p>
While Reeves got ready the ice-hooks, sledges,
warps, and gangs of seal-hunters, with their bats,
guns, and other apparatus, Hartly and I were
treading to and fro talking of various matters.  I
can remember that he was relating to me, how, in
his last voyage with the <i>Leda</i> up the Mediterranean,
St. Elmo's blue and phosphorescent light had
enveloped fully three feet of her masts below the
trucks, to the great terror of Cuffy Snowball, and
others who were ignorant of the cause of that
phenomenon, which lasted nearly an hour.  He was
proceeding with his narration, when Tom Hammer,
who was repairing something aloft, hailed the watch.
</p>

<p>
"Deck&mdash;ahoy!"
</p>

<p>
"Hallo?" responded Hans Peterkin.
</p>

<p>
"There is a craft wedged in the ice, sir."
</p>

<p>
"Where away?"
</p>

<p>
"About twenty miles off."
</p>

<p>
"How does she bear?"
</p>

<p>
"On our lee bow."
</p>

<p>
"And what do you make her out to be?"
</p>

<p>
Hammer stood on the main-crosstrees, with his
left arm embracing the mast, and through his
telescope took a long and steady glance with a somewhat
perplexed air at this vessel, which we could not
see from the deck.
</p>

<p>
"She is a brig with her topgallant masts struck."
</p>

<p>
"Indeed!"
</p>

<p>
"No," stammered the carpenter.
</p>

<p>
"What then?"
</p>

<p>
"A ship with all her canvas unbent."
</p>

<p>
"Unbent! that is strange," said Hartly, shading
his eyes, and peering away to leeward.
</p>

<p>
"No&mdash;now, sir, she looks like a brigantine, or
hermaphrodite brig, with her yards topped up in
different ways."
</p>

<p>
"Do you wish your nightcap sent up to you,
Tom?" said the mate, drily; "look again, perhaps
she is the <i>Flying Dutchman</i>."
</p>

<p>
"Or the ghost of the <i>Black Schooner</i>," said one.
</p>

<p>
"Or a whale," added another.
</p>

<p>
But on nearing the edge of the ice-field&mdash;so close
that we sent off the mate in the jolly boat with the
warps, and handed our canvas, preparatory to
resuming the war against the seals&mdash;we could all see
the vessel which Hammer had discerned, lying
among the ice about fifteen miles off, and various
were the discussions on board as to her rig and
nation.  Even our oldest seamen were puzzled.
Her hull was scarcely visible, so high were the
hummocks around her.  She had two masts, but
her spars were, as Tom said, topped up in various
ways and at various angles, and seemed covered
by long-accumulated ice and snow, from which we
augured that she had been long beset.
</p>

<p>
We hoisted our colours and displayed the private
signal of Messrs. Manly and Skrew, but received no
response, by which we supposed that she had been
deserted by her crew, or that her signal halliards
had given way.
</p>

<p>
Some averred stoutly that they could distinguish
a flag flying at her gaff peak; others that she had
no gaff peak whatever, but had <i>one</i> man seated in
her fore rigging.  Hartly ridiculed these fancies,
saying that the intensity of the cold, and the
dazzling glare of the sun shining on a sea covered
by white ice, bewildered the vision of most men;
and so, full of vague conjectures as to what our
neighbours might be, we saw the sun set and night
close in upon us.
</p>

<p>
Next morning another large field of ice was
discovered on our larboard quarter, closing in upon us
with considerable rapidity.  It extended along the
offing for twelve or fourteen miles, and increased to
the eye as it was borne towards us by an under-current.
</p>

<p>
Hartly conjectured it had drifted down Hudson's
Strait from the Bay, and to avoid being <i>beset</i> like
the unfortunate craft we had been observing, he
brought off the ice-anchor and made sail on the
brig, steering due west and keeping her close hauled
with his starboard tacks on board; but the field of
ice we endeavoured to leave kept close alongside, as
if it sailed or floated <i>with</i> us, which I have no doubt
it did.
</p>

<p>
Thus both fields verged towards each other rapidly,
one before the wind, the other before a current; and
so, ere sunset, we were closely wedged in a frozen
sea&mdash;BESET, amid a wilderness of pack-ice, of bergs, and
hummocks, which extended, as far as the eye could
discern from the main-crosstrees, in every direction,
and probably far beyond the horizon.
</p>

<p>
Though this predicament was not without great
peril, still it was preferable by many degrees to our
last situation; for here we could pursue the object
of our expedition, and hoped to have our cargo
complete, the hatches battened down, and all ready for
our return to Newfoundland when the ice broke up,
amid the warmer water of more southern latitudes,
towards which we expected the field, like others,
would be borne by the currents.
</p>

<p>
Alas! how little did we then foresee how long we
and our desolate neighbour, whose disordered aspect
and bare spars made her resemble a withered bush
or bunch of reeds at the horizon, were to remain in
sight of each other.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap16"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XVI.
<br /><br />
BESET WITHOUT HOPE.
</h3>

<p>
I cared little about the slaughter of the seals,&mdash;indeed,
I rather disliked it&mdash;and for several days my
attention was excited solely by the vessel which was
beset so far from us.
</p>

<p>
My imagination drew many painful scenes.  I
endeavoured to picture how long she had been
there&mdash;weeks, months, it might be years!
</p>

<p>
Where was she from?  What had she been&mdash;a
ship, brig, or schooner? for by the confusion of her
rigging, and the distance at which she lay from us,
there was a difficulty in discovering this, even by
by our most powerful glasses, or whether the smoke
ever rose from her galley funnel.
</p>

<p>
How many of her crew were alive, or had she a
crew at all?  If so, what were their sufferings&mdash;if
abandoned, amid that world of ice, whither had
they gone, and where had their perilous journey
ended?  On Greenland, on the Labrador, or in the
grave?
</p>

<p>
These queries were for ever recurring to me, and
that old beset ship&mdash;I had made up my mind that
she <i>was</i> old&mdash;was the first object to which my eyes
turned when coming on deck in the morning, and
the last at night.  Fogs&mdash;the dense fogs of the Arctic
seas&mdash;came on and shrouded us for days, till one's
lungs almost filled with icy vapour, and the pulses
of the heart seemed to freeze.  The wind blew a
gale at times, but the ice remained fast as adamant
around us; but when the obscurity passed away,
there lay the beset ship in the dim distance,
wearing the same lifeless aspect as ever, so dreary and
forlorn amid that waste of cold white glistening ice,
with its endless vistas of hummocks and splintered
bergs.
</p>

<p>
We became somewhat alarmed on discovering by
observations that instead of drifting into southern
latitudes, where the ice-fields are usually broken
into floes, and a ship becomes free to shape her
course in any direction, we were being borne almost
due west, and with considerable rapidity.  By this
the temperature remained nearly the same, and our
besetting, like that of our unfortunate neighbour,
became a permanence, and would probably continue
so, unless we weathered Cape Farewell, of which
Hartly had some doubts at that season.
</p>

<p>
We had now reached the first week of April, and
could only look forward to the early days of May,
when the field-ice breaks up, and from the unknown
seas and inlets of the north, floats southward in
masses so mighty, that a girdle of ice, sometimes two
hundred miles in breadth, environs the coasts of
Newfoundland and the Labrador.
</p>

<p>
Ere long we became sensible of a tremendous
pressure upon the sides of the brig, a pressure so
great that her timbers in some places became
distorted, and Hartly was seriously alarmed lest she
might be crushed and destroyed.
</p>

<p>
This unwonted pressure rendered us very anxious,
and inspired many with dread.
</p>

<p>
One night when it was greater than usual, I was
on deck, and from thence ascended into the main-rigging
a little way to contemplate the snow-covered
scene&mdash;so vast, so silent, and so terrible in its beauty!
</p>

<p>
Spreading far as the eye could reach&mdash;far beyond
the old deserted ship, for such we deemed her now&mdash;lay
the hummocks in uncounted myriads, ascending
here and there into bergs and mountains, so
impressive in their cold purity, so solemnizing in their
silence and monotony, their spiral peaks glistening
and vitreous against the blue immensity of the
sky&mdash;an accumulation of ice and snow that would seem
to have lasted since the will and hand of God had
first separated the land from the water, and marked
the limits of both.
</p>

<p>
While lost in reverie, and surveying this scene, a
strange sound, like that which might be caused by
the rending of a vast rock asunder, fell upon my
ear; then there was a shock which made every
fibre in my body tingle.  A mighty power below us
seemed to be hoisting the brig out of the ice, while
her masts and hull began to sway to and fro.
</p>

<p>
"Aloft, lads&mdash;all hands aloft!" cried Hartly;
"we are about to be crushed&mdash;God help us! for all
is over with us now!"
</p>

<p>
All our men rushed into the rigging on hearing
this terrible announcement, and at the same moment
there was another crashing shock, and lo! about a
league from us, there ascended slowly and vertically
into the air, a sheet or wall of ice, perhaps twenty
feet thick, nearly a hundred feet in height, and
several miles in length!
</p>

<p>
Erect it stood for some moments, like a giant
rampart, and then broke into fragments, and as the
field collapsed below, these fell with a roar as if
heaven and earth were coming together.
</p>

<p>
How many <i>millions of tons</i> might have been in
that erected mass no man could conceive, but the
thunder of their fall, as they crashed and glittered
in the moonlight, caused one's soul to shrink with
awe and wonder at the grandeur and sublimity of
such a scene.
</p>

<p>
The ice around us cracked and rent in every
direction, but though there was a vibration, a
seeming heaving of the icebound sea, the brig settled
down again into her bed, and we were only relieved
of that intense pressure which had threatened
us with immediate destruction.
</p>

<p>
"We are saved&mdash;for this time," said Hartly.
</p>

<p>
"Have the currents caused this?" I inquired.
</p>

<p>
"Partly: and the east edge of the ice-field has
crashed upon a western shore."
</p>

<p>
"Greenland?" suggested Paul Reeves.
</p>

<p>
"Of course."
</p>

<p>
"Then we are to the <i>north</i> of Cape Farewell!"
</p>

<p>
I gazed wistfully towards the east.  Hartly saw
the glance, and smiled.
</p>

<p>
"You wish to snuff the land," said he; "but
whether the land on which this mass of ice that
imprisons us and our neighbour&mdash;a floating mass
perhaps as large as Ireland&mdash;be just below the
horizon, or two hundred miles distant, I have no
means of ascertaining until I make a correct
observation at noon."
</p>

<p>
The morrow came duly, and at twelve o'clock,
Hartly, on consulting the sun and his chart, declared
that we were at least one hundred and seventy miles
due westward of Cape Farewell, on the coast of
Greenland.  We had thus drifted before the wind
many hundred miles with the ice.  The cold
had now rendered the action of our compasses
sluggish; but, situated as we were, that was of
little consequence.
</p>

<p>
Our anxiety increased as our provisions diminished;
we were placed upon a scanty allowance;
symptoms of scurvy became visible among our seal-fishers;
and how shall I find words to describe the
intensity of the cold?
</p>

<p>
As we huddled together in the cabin at night, the
ice actually came down the funnel of the stove, and
formed a little arch above the fire.  Our breath froze
on our beards and whiskers, and on the blankets of
our beds.  The barrels of salted junk had to be
dashed to pieces ere the food could be separated
from the brine and staves.  Stiff grog froze as hard
as our beer; and every day a smoky haze rose from
the sea, and freezing as it rose, when blown about
by the wind, seemed to scrape the very skin off one's
face.  This frost-rime frequently enveloped us like a
dense fog for days, and when it cleared, the wearied
eye had no object to rest on but the everlasting ice
and the old ship in the dreary distance.
</p>

<p>
Chancing to stumble one day against the anchor,
my bare hand touched the fluke, and a portion of
skin adhered to it as if it had been hot iron.
</p>

<p>
We hunted diligently for seals, as they formed
our staple food, when cooked on a fire of blazing
blubber.  The flesh of the cub, especially the heart
and liver, when hashed, and well seasoned with
pepper, was not unacceptable to appetites sharpened
by the northern blast that came from the Arctic
circle.
</p>

<p>
The middle of April came and passed away without
a change, save that the sun shone with a brilliance
which somewhat alleviated the cold.  One
day, at noon, I saw Hartly form a piece of pure
fresh-water ice from the scuttle-bucket into a lens,
through which he concentrated the rays of the sun
as through a burning-glass, and thus igniting little
puffs of powder on the capstan-head, to the great
astonishment of our seamen, and the terror of
Cuffy, who began to consider him a species of Obi
man.
</p>

<p>
So day followed day of captivity!
</p>

<p>
Seal-hunting and idling over, we would assemble,
and sit for hour after hour, crouching close together
for warmth, around our little fire, watching the
glowing embers and the upward sparks; often in
dreamy silence, mentally wondering where, when,
and <i>how</i> this monotony, misery, and suffering were
to end!
</p>

<p>
At times each almost fancied himself the last man
in the world&mdash;and certainly we were the last men to
be envied.  Then terrible sensations crept over us,
and horror filled our souls&mdash;the horror of being the
<i>last survivor</i>, when famine and death came together
among us.
</p>

<p>
As a relief from this intolerable monotony, a party
of us resolved to visit the other ship.  All were
anxious to go; but Hartly said we could never
know the moment when the ice would partially break
up; thus half the crew at least must remain with
him for the safety of the whole.
</p>

<p>
Furnished with a sledge, on which we placed a
supply of such provisions as the <i>Leda</i> could afford,
a small breaker, or gang-cask of stiff grog, hatchets,
guns, a compass, plenty of blankets, and tobacco, so
as to be ready for any emergency or detention,
twelve men&mdash;Paul Reeves, Hans Peterkin, Tom
Hammer, Cuffy, and myself inclusive&mdash;departed one
bright morning about an hour after dawn, resolved
to overhaul the stranger, and if we found her
deserted, to cut away her masts, and drag them to the
brig for fuel, though she lay now at least fifteen
miles distant.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XVII.
<br /><br />
THE DEATH-SHIP.
</h3>

<p>
Inured though we were to the cold, we felt the toil
and peril very great when traversing the ice for
fifteen miles; but fortunately the day was clear,
and not a speck of cloud appeared upon the blue
immensity of the sky.
</p>

<p>
The crew of the <i>Leda</i> cheered us from time to
time until we were at some distance, when they
hoisted a red flag at the mainmast-head; but in the
hollows between the hummocks and vast blocks of
ice which were jammed and piled upon each other
by the recent concussion and compression of the
field, we lost sight of both ships at times, and could
only discover them while surmounting some of the
frozen ridges.
</p>

<p>
We toiled bravely, anxious to attain the object
of our journey ere night came on, as we were assured
of quarter on board, whatever might be the circumstances
of this strange-looking craft, the attention of
whose crew our colours by day, and our lanterns by
night, had totally failed to attract.
</p>

<p>
Fifteen miles over an ice-field&mdash;especially such
an ice-field as that which inclosed us, rent by chasms
in some places, and piled in giant blocks elsewhere&mdash;were
equal to the toil of traversing forty miles on
land; thus about two P.M., we found ourselves only
eight miles from the <i>Leda</i>, but rapidly gaining on
the hull of the strange craft, which seemed to rise
out of the ice as we approached, and the aspect of
which puzzled us more than ever.  We halted for a
brief space; then each man partook of a biscuit and
piece of seal's flesh boiled, a ration of rum, and in
ten minutes more we pushed on again, four dragging
our sledge, laden with stores, by shoulder-belts
made for the purpose, and relieved by other four
at every two miles or so.
</p>

<p>
Our expedition was not without several dangers.
Fog might come on and conceal both ships from us;
a blinding storm of snow might have the same
effect, and pile its drifts above our corpses for ever.
The ice-field might break up, and separate us from
our ship so long that when our slender stock of
necessaries was expended, we should infallibly perish.
Each man among us thought of these possible and
terrible contingencies as the distance increased
between us and the <i>Leda</i>&mdash;our home amid the icy
waste&mdash;but none spoke of them <i>then</i>; all sang
cheerily, and pushed on to overhaul the strange
craft; thus about five in the afternoon we found
ourselves alongside, and all paused to survey her
with deep and undefinable emotions of awe in our
breasts, for she had evidently been long deserted,
and now wore a most chilling and desolate aspect.
</p>

<p>
She was an old-fashioned pink-built barque, of
about six hundred tons, with bulging ribs and bluff
bows; broad and clumsy in the counter and deep in
the bends&mdash;all fenced about with iron bands; she
looked like a whaler of George the Second's time,
for, with a fiddle head, she had the remains of a
jack-staff and spritsail yard upon her bowsprit.
Her hull and spars were thickly coated with ice.
</p>

<p>
Her fore and main topmasts were gone; her mizen
was broken off at the crosstrees, and hung, truck
downward, in its gear.
</p>

<p>
The topping-lifts and braces of the yards had
long since given way, and tatters of them swung
mournfully on the wind.  Many of the yards had
dropped from their slings, and lay athwart the deck
or among the ice alongside, where the gales had
tossed them.
</p>

<p>
Her ironwork was red and corroded; almost every
vestige of paint and tar had long since disappeared,
as if she had been scraped by the ice; beaten,
battered, and washed by Arctic storms, American
fogs, and Greenland showers of sleet and rain, for
many, many years must have elapsed since the keel
of this old craft had last been in blue water, and
first been frozen in the treacherous ice; years
of drifting to and fro in the far and frozen regions
of the north, where perchance not even the eye of
the Esquimaux had seen her.
</p>

<p>
We seemed all to read and know her history
instinctively at a glance; but her crew&mdash;what had
their fate been?
</p>

<p>
Inspired by a strange emotion, we hung back,
while gazing at her, as she stood like a silent ruin,
or the ghost of a ship in the frosty sunshine of the
April evening; but no man attempted to board her,
till Paul Reeves, taking a hatchet from the sledge,
exclaimed,
</p>

<p>
"Come on, shipmates&mdash;we'll overhaul her!" and
proceeded at once to mount from the ice into her
mainchains.  As he grasped the starboard shrouds
about the upper dead-eyes, the whole gave way from
their rotten cat-harpings and crashed about him, with
a shower of the ice that had coated them for years.
</p>

<p>
"By Jove! lads, 'twas not yesterday this craft
left the rigger's hands!" said he, as we clambered
after him, and at length stood upon her deck, which
was coated about two feet deep with hard frozen
snow, on the pure whiteness of which no foot-track
was visible.
</p>

<p>
Sailors are ever superstitious; but theirs is an
honest and reverential superstition, very different
from that of the landsman; thus in breathless
silence our party paused upon her deck, as if it had
been the lid of a huge coffin.
</p>

<p>
"Go on&mdash;go on!" said several; yet no man
moved, for there was a deathlike silence in and
around her.
</p>

<p>
Her main-hatch was battened down; but we
could see that the companion aft and the fore-hatch
were partly open.  Her long-boat was turned keel
upmost on deck, aft the foremast; and by other
indications it had doubtless formed a species of
round-house.  Various large white bones, fragments
of broken casks, coils of old bleached ropes, and
rusty harpoons were strewn about, and served to
indicate that she had been a whale-ship.
</p>

<p>
Urged by curiosity, I proceeded towards her
cabin, my eleven shipmates following closely at my
heels.
</p>

<p>
The skylight was covered with snow; yet
through a broken pane I could perceive the figures
of men below: then I turned to descend into her
dark, gloomy, and slimy cabin, on entering which
I beheld a wondrous scene of horror, such as can
never be forgotten by me, nor was it by those who
accompanied me.
</p>

<p>
The red glow of the sun, now setting beyond the
distant waste of ice, shone from the west through
her two square stern windows, pouring athwart her
cabin a sombre and dusky light.  Its sides were
covered by a damp mould, which was green and thick
as moss.  Nearly three feet of snow, which had
drifted down the companion-hatch, was lying upon
its floor; half buried among it and huddled close
together in a corner, lay the bodies of three
emaciated men, with fur caps tied under their
wasted jaws.
</p>

<p>
A blue and ghastly hand that hung over one of
the cabin berths announced that a dead man lay
there; and seated at the table was another, whose
arms, head, and back were half covered by the snow,
that had drifted over him after he had sunk into the
sleep of death.  His coat was old in fashion, with
large brass buttons and square pocket-flaps.  Amid
the snow that covered the table, and amid which
his face was hidden, there appeared the necks of
one or two square case-bottles&mdash;empty.
</p>

<p>
A quill was also standing amid the snow, and
seemed to indicate that the dead man had been
writing, for it was still in the pewter inkhorn, and
near it stood a lamp, used by him probably to keep
his ink from freezing.  Close by appeared the corner
of a book, which I drew with difficulty from amid
the frozen snow, and then impelled by a horror, of
that cold dark floating grave, like frightened
schoolboys we rushed up the cabin-stairs, and regained
the deck, just as the last segment of the sun's red
disc went down beyond the frozen sea.
</p>

<p>
We stood in a group near the mouldering mainmast,
gazing at each other awe-struck, for we had
looked on the faces of men who had been dead for
years&mdash;how many, we knew not.
</p>

<p>
"There is <i>something moving</i> in the forehold!"
exclaimed Tom Hammer, the carpenter, while his
teeth chattered alike with cold and fear.
</p>

<p>
"Something?" I reiterated.
</p>

<p>
"Ay, sir, and alive, too!  Do you hear <i>that</i>?"
added old Hans Peterkin, in terror.
</p>

<p>
It was a strange, croaking sound; and then, as we
approached the half-open hatch of the forehold, we
heard the flapping of large wings.
</p>

<p>
Though almost paralysed by hearing such an
unwonted sound in such a place, one of our
seal-fishers fired his gun in his confusion.  I crept
forward and peeped fearfully down, but could not
distinguish anything amid the gloom below.
</p>

<p>
Then we heard another croak, which sounded so
loud and so dreadful to our over-strained organs of
hearing that it nearly made us all scamper over the
side; when suddenly two giant ravens, who had
doubtless long made the empty wreck their home,
rose through the fore-hatchway on their black
booming pinions, and soaring high into the clear air,
winged their way directly to the east, and so swiftly
that they soon disappeared.
</p>

<p>
"The land lies where they are flying to," said
Reeves.
</p>

<p>
"And it is not far off, as their presence here
would indicate," added a seaman.
</p>

<p>
This idea encouraged us all very much, as we
forgot that they might have floated with the ice-field
for years.  We were about to descend into the
forehold, but on lifting the other half of the decayed
hatch, we found the frozen remains of a man
hanging there by the neck, and half devoured by those
obscene birds.  A capstan-bar had been placed
athwart the combing, and to this he had suspended
himself by a well-greased rope.
</p>

<p>
Was this unfortunate the last survivor, who, in
desperation, had thus awfully ended his misery?
</p>

<p>
His situation seemed to say so.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XVIII.
<br /><br />
LEAVES FROM THE LOG.
</h3>

<p>
We repaired to our sledge alongside, and dragging
it a little way from the deserted barque, took a ration
of grog (of which we stood much in need), and then
I proceeded to examine the volume we had brought
away.  It proved to be the mouldered fragments of
a log-book or diary kept by the mate&mdash;doubtless the
dead man, who was seated on the stern locker, and
whose body was reclining on the snow-covered cabin
table.
</p>

<p>
From this book we could glean that she was the
<i>Royal Bounty</i>, a Peterhead whaler, which had been
beset in the ice off Cape Desolation in 1801, and
that one by one all her crew had perished of cold,
hunger, and despair!
</p>

<p>
The thick and crystalline coat of ice which covered
every portion of the ship, from her tops to her
chain-plates&mdash;a coat that had never melted or been
disturbed&mdash;had protected her rigging, spars, and hull
from the natural progress of decay; so let none
suppose it marvellous that in a region or atmosphere
of eternal snow, bodies are also thus preserved; for
frequently the remains of elephants and mammoths
which lived before the flood, and of pre-Adamite
monsters, are found buried in the Arctic ice,
unchanged, undecayed, and entire.
</p>

<p>
At the mouth of the Lena, in Siberia&mdash;a river
which traverses the vast and uninhabited plains of
Asiatic Russia&mdash;there was discovered, in 1805, a
mammoth entire, with the hair on its skin four
inches long, and all of a reddish-black; and so
frequently are similar discoveries made along the shores
of the Frozen Sea, that the poor Russians believe
that race of animals to be still extant in their
country, but existing like moles which dwell
underground, and cannot endure the light of day; and
their exhumation from the ice is ever deemed a
forerunner of calamity, as it is said that all who see
them die soon after.  But to resume.
</p>

<p>
The book was much mouldered and decayed; only
a few entries here and there could be traced, as its
leaves, now soft and pulpy, perished in our fingers
when we attempted to turn them over.  A few
passages ran thus:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"March 3rd, 1801; a brisk breeze from the S.W.
The Faroe Isles bearing about twenty miles off on
our starboard quarter.
</p>

<p>
"At 7 P.M., took in the topgallant sails, and all

</p>

<p>
"April 4, 8 P.M.  Set more canvas&mdash;out reefs&mdash;set

captain ordered ........, and Cairns ........
</p>

<p>
"9 P.M.  Land ahead&mdash;supposed to be Cape Farewell.
Weather squally.  Beset by an ice-field in a
strong current running N. and by E.  Took in
everything fore and aft&mdash;sent down the
topgallantyards, and brought the masts on deck ........"
</p>

<p>
After a successful whale fishing in latitude 76°-77°,
they had been again, or were still, beset.
</p>

<p>
"1st May, 1801; hoisted a garland of false
flowers, made by our wives and sweethearts at home
in Scotland, between the fore and mainmast........"
</p>

<p>
Then followed days and weeks, to the effect that
they were <i>still beset</i>.  These memoranda were in
the handwriting of various persons, and were
frequently mingled with earnest prayers for release.
Then scurvy appears to have broken out among
them, and disease was quickly followed by death.
</p>

<p>
"1802.  Birnie from Buchan-ness, off duty,
unwell&mdash;Birnie's teeth fell out of his head.  Willie
Cairns from Southhouse Head, off duty, unwell.
Poor Birnie died, and was buried in the ice, where
the <i>others</i> lie, half a mile off, on the starboard bow.
God rest them!
</p>

<p>
"May 6th.  Jobson ill with scurvy and blindness&mdash;Cairns
died, and was buried beside Birnie ........."
</p>

<p>
Many leaves totally illegible followed, till we
deciphered a passage like this&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"1802, 4th Dec.  The captain died in his berth
this day at 8 A.M., and we are too weak to move
him.  Smith, Arthur, and the cook are dead, or dying
of hunger on the cabin floor!  We have now been
beset two years and twenty-one days.  In that time
twenty-four men have died out of a crew of
nine-and-twenty&mdash;no hope! no mercy!  My God! where
is all this to end?  We sailed upon a Friday, and
this ........"
</p>

<p>
I shut the book abruptly, for I could perceive in
the twilight a blank horror stealing over the pale
features of my companions as we stood beside that
old vessel&mdash;a frozen tomb; and favoured by the
light of the rising moon, we proceeded to regain the
<i>Leda</i>, with all the speed we could exert; for to some
it appeared as if our future fate was fearfully
foreshadowed in the story of this old doomed whale-ship.
Half a mile distant, on her starboard bow, an ice-coated
pole was visible.  It seemed to indicate where
her dead were buried.
</p>

<p>
Hans Peterkin and three others strapped the
collar-ropes over their shoulders for the first "spell,"
and proceeded briskly in front with our sledge of
blankets, &amp;c.  The rest followed in silence, and only
turned from time to time to cast a backward glance
at the old whaler, whose decaying spars, coated with
ice, glimmered darkly against the starry sky.  The
moon arose in her full northern splendour&mdash;clear,
glorious, and wondrous!  The sharp summits of the
bergs (the ice-mountains that rose from the plains
of ice) gleamed and glittered like mighty prisms,
or spires, pyramids, and obelisks of crystal and
spar.
</p>

<p>
After all we had seen, the dead, the awful stillness
of the frozen sea&mdash;that snow-clad plain, "the
silence of which seemed to come from afar and to go
afar," impressed us with deep and solemn emotions.
Thus, for several miles we trod gloomily on, equally
desirous of reaching the <i>Leda</i> and of leaving far
behind the scene of gloom I have described.
</p>

<p>
The spirits of our party were sorely depressed;
but Paul Reeves and I did everything in our power,
by cheerfulness and anecdotes, to divert the gloomy
current of their ideas; though poor Paul was not
without fears that a day might come when he would
be inserting in the log of the <i>Leda</i>, entries similar
to those I have quoted from the mouldering volume
we had brought away.
</p>

<p>
"We have found a ship of the dead," said he,
"but that is nothing!  What think you, shipmates,
of a whole city full?"
</p>

<p>
"A city full!" reiterated our men.
</p>

<p>
"Not exactly a city like London&mdash;but a city,
nevertheless."
</p>

<p>
"And where was this?" asked Hans, doubtfully.
</p>

<p>
"I read of it in a book&mdash;a real printed book&mdash;when
I was in South Carolina.  There was one
Lionel Wafer, an English surgeon, who, having
nobody to physic at home, took a voyage with the old
buccaneers to the South Seas.  Well, on one occasion,
his craft was cruising off Vermijo, at the mouth
of the Red River, in Peru.  It was a wild and solitary
place; but he went ashore with a boat's crew, and
travelled four miles up the stream in quest of
adventures; and there, from the margin of a fine sandy
bay, a plain spread inland as wide as this ice-field,
all covered with the ruins of streets, built of mighty
blocks of stone carved with wonderful sculptures,
like those of the Egyptians&mdash;only more terrible and
quaint; and among these crumbling streets and
mansions were thousands of graves half open, with
the dead bodies of men, women, and little children in
them, all mummified and light as cork, for they had
been dead two hundred years or more.
</p>

<p>
"His men were terrified, and fled back to their
boat; but on the way they met an old Indian, who
related that, in the days of his forefathers, this arid
plain had once been fruitful and green as the greenest
savannah, and the country so populous, that a fish
of the Red River could have been passed through
the land from hand to hand, till it was laid at the
foot of the throne of the Inca (that was their king,
shipmates); but the cruel, murdering Spaniards came,
with their guns and bloodhounds, and laid siege
to the capital city.  Its defence was long and
desperate; and rather than yield, the inhabitants slew
themselves, and buried each other in the sand, till
there was only one man left, and <i>he</i> drowned himself
in the Red River.
</p>

<p>
"In after years the stormy winds had blown the
dry sand aside, and there the grim Mexicans lay in
thousands&mdash;the women with the pearls of Vermijo
at their ears and round their necks, their little
children, their distaffs and hand-mills by their sides,
and their long black hair filled with coins and
precious stones.  There, too, lay the warriors, with
their flint axes and broken spears, and the war-paint
yet traceable on their mummies.  Lionel Wafer
brought away the body of a child, but the
buccaneers would not admit it on board lest it might
bring a plague or a curse upon them; so he threw
it into the Rio Grande."
</p>

<p>
This yarn produced others equally lively, of course;
but while conversing we got over the dreary waste of
hummocks more rapidly, and some time after midnight
were welcomed on board the <i>Leda</i>, where those
whom we had left were burning with curiosity to
learn the result of our expedition.
</p>

<p>
The impression of all we had seen was so vivid,
that a horror lest the same fate should befal us,
made our men suggest and revolve every rash plan
for release.
</p>

<p>
The flight of the two ravens eastward indicated
that land could not be far off.  Hans Peterkin, a
hardy Orcadian, who was suffering from scurvy,
proposed that if matters grew more desperate, we
should travel over the field, taking with us the
longboat upon sledge-runners.  Some urged that we
should bore through the ice with canvas set, while
gangs went ahead blasting it up with gunpowder.
</p>

<p>
"Bore and blast through ice twenty feet thick,
for a hundred miles, perhaps!" said Hartly, with
sorrowful irony.
</p>

<p>
But scurvy continued to increase among us; and
on the eighth day after our visit to the ship one of
our crew died, and was buried in the ice; while the
brig was thrown in mourning, her colours half-mast,
her running-gear cast in loose bights, and her yards
topped up variously.
</p>

<p>
After his funeral, which had a most depressing
effect upon us all, I remarked to Hartly, that either
by a strange coincidence or by an irresistible fatality,
we had interred him <i>half a mile distant on the starboard
bow</i>, exactly as the crew of the old whaler had
interred <i>their dead</i>!
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XIX.
<br /><br />
THE GRAVES ON THE STARBOARD BOW.
</h3>

<p>
The last of our stone ballast had long since been
thrown overboard on the ice, and was replaced by
seal skins.  We had now a valuable cargo, over
which the hatches were barred and battened; but
Hartly's hopes for an honest profit on his adventurous
expedition were forgotten, or merged in the
overwhelming desire for freedom and the safety of
our lives and of the brig.
</p>

<p>
Already five deaths were recorded in her log; and
Hartly vowed that if ever again her bows cut blue
water, he would never more tempt Dame Fortune
in <i>the region of ice</i>.
</p>

<p>
By this time our monotonous detention had so
far exceeded every expectation and contingency; that
our beer, rum, and other spirits, our salted beef,
preserved meats, and lime-juice were consumed;
and though our biscuits were doled out in very
small rations indeed, grim starvation was before us,
or food composed of seal and blubber alone; so scurvy
in its worst forms assailed us all more or less.  Our
strongest seamen were the first who sank under it:
their complexions became yellow, with swollen
gums, loosened teeth, and fetid breath.  These
symptoms were accompanied by a difficulty in
respiring, which, on the least exertion being made,
amounted almost to suffocation.
</p>

<p>
Two of our gunners died one evening within an
hour of each other.  We wrapped them in blankets,
and buried them quickly, under cloud of night, lest
the survivors might be affected by the scene.
</p>

<p>
Hartly, Hans Peterkin, Cuffy, and I performed
this melancholy office, when we had no lamp but
the twinkling stars and the sharp streamers of the
northern lights, shooting upward from the icebergs
that edged the plain, over which the wind blew keen
and bitingly.
</p>

<p>
Grim seemed the pale faces of the dead in that
wavering gloom, as we lowered them into their last
home, heaped the ice above them, and returned
to the <i>Leda</i>, leaving them to sleep the sleep of
death among their shipmates <i>half a mile distant on
her starboard bow</i>.
</p>

<p>
And now with each day there sank a deeper horror
over us&mdash;the horror that, like the old whaler at the
horizon, the <i>Leda</i> was a ship foredoomed!  Yet, like
her, we had <i>not</i> sailed upon a Friday.
</p>

<p>
We were without a surgeon; but Hartly was a
skilful fellow, and by administering such simples as
we possessed, he endeavoured to ameliorate the
condition of his suffering crew.
</p>

<p>
Common potatoes he washed, cut into thin slices,
and gave raw to some, for the cure of their swollen
and bleeding gums&mdash;usually a sovereign remedy in
this case.  To others he gave decoctions of tamarinds,
scraped from an old gallipot, and boiled with cream
of tartar; or a ship biscuit pounded into a panada,
and sweetened with sugar; or gargles made of
honey of roses and elixir of vitriol; but, ere long,
even these remedies failed us; and we had Reeves,
Hans Peterkin, and more than half our remaining
crew, unable to raise their heads or hands, sick and
despairing.
</p>

<p>
The miserable Esquimaux, by scraping the snow
from their native rocks, can find coarse berries,
sorrel, and cresses, with which to correct their
blubber food; but in that world of ice we had no
such boon accorded us.
</p>

<p>
Armed with our rifles and knives, I set forth with
two of our healthiest men, Dick and James Abbot,
two brothers, in search of a few fresh seals, as they
had learned to shun our locality, and had ceased to
venture through their holes in the ice for some time
past.
</p>

<p>
We left the brig about two o'clock, P.M.
</p>

<p>
On this day the wind was blowing hard, the
white scud was flying fast through the blue sky,
and for the first time we felt a heaving motion in
the ice, which warned us instinctively not to venture
far from the <i>Leda</i>.  After a ramble of three hours,
we had only shot one seal and knocked two cubs on
the head with our rifle-butts, when we sat down on
a hummock to rest, at the distance of two miles or
so from our ice-bound home.
</p>

<p>
"I wonder much how the masts of that old craft
the <i>Bounty</i> have stood these many years?" said
Dick Abbot, breaking a long silence.
</p>

<p>
"The coating of ice has saved them, as it has
preserved everything on board&mdash;from decay, at
least," replied his brother.
</p>

<p>
"Always thinking of that ship," said I, with an
air of annoyance.  "Come, let us talk of something
more cheerful.  You know that she&mdash;but <i>where is
she</i>?" I added, as we swept the horizon in vain for
her&mdash;the sole object on which our eyes had rested
for so many dreary weeks.
</p>

<p>
"Sunk, by Jove! or can her old spars have gone
by the board at last?" exclaimed James Abbot,
starting up.
</p>

<p>
In great excitement we clambered to the summit
of a mass of ice, and looked around us.  Not a
vestige of the old barque could be seen, but dense
clouds that came heavily up from the north were
overspreading the sky, against the blue of which
her crystal-coated spars had so long been visible.
</p>

<p>
"We shall have foul weather," said Dick Abbot.
</p>

<p>
"And so they seem to think, sir, aboard the
brig," added his brother: "see&mdash;they've run the
ensign up to the gaff peak as a signal for us to
return, Mr. Manly."
</p>

<p>
"But our three seals&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"We must leave them where they are&mdash;that big
hummock will mark where they lie till to-morrow."
</p>

<p>
"James is right, sir," said Dick Abbot; "let us
get back to the brig as fast as we can."
</p>

<p>
"She is two miles distant, at least," said I.
</p>

<p>
"The sky darkens fast; and see&mdash;see!" he added,
with wild joy expressed in all his features, his eyes,
and voice; "the captain expects something&mdash;they've
cast loose the courses, and are hoisting the
topsailyards&mdash;THE ICE IS BREAKING UP!"
</p>

<p>
These words made every pulse quicken, and as if
in corroboration of his surmise, we felt the field on
which we trod agitated by convulsive throes, and
these increased as the fierce and darkening blast,
armed with showers of hailstones large as peas, that
fell aslant the cold grey sky, deepened the atmosphere
around us.  Madly we toiled, scrambled, and rolled&mdash;fell,
rose, and fell again&mdash;shouted and cheered to
each other, as we surmounted the endless succession
of glassy hummocks and snowy hollows to reach
the <i>Leda</i>; but the gloom increased so fast, that in
less than half an hour we could no longer distinguish
where she lay.
</p>

<p>
We did not feel cold&mdash;our brains seemed on fire,
our bloodshot eyes were wild and eager in expression,
as we toiled on and on&mdash;but <i>where</i> was the brig?
</p>

<p>
A misty veil of hail and snow&mdash;an atmosphere
dark as the twilight of the Scandinavian gods&mdash;enveloped
us like a curtain.  We paused at times in
our desperation, and uttered a simultaneous hallo;
but no voice replied, no sound responded, save the
hiss of the hailstones as they showered on the hard
hummocks.  Then we heard from time to time a
stunning crash, as the field was rent asunder into
floes, that were surged and driven against each
other with such force as the waves of an irresistible
sea can alone exert.
</p>

<p>
To us this crisis was, as I have said, maddening.
We tossed away our rifles, shot-belts, knives, bats,
and everything that might impede our progress,
and toiled in wild despair in search of the <i>Leda</i>&mdash;but
alas, alas! the <i>Leda</i> was nowhere to be seen!
</p>

<p>
"Can we have passed her?" we asked repeatedly.
</p>

<p>
To return was to acknowledge still more that we
were at fault.
</p>

<p>
Left upon the breaking ice, with night deepening,
and a tempest, perhaps, coming on together;
the ice-field rending into floes, and the <i>Leda</i>, when
last seen, with her topsails loose for sea, and now
we knew not where, but assuredly not within call
of our united voices, which the envious wind, the
very spirit of the wintry storm, swept from our
trembling lips, as if in mockery of efforts and
struggles so feeble as those of man when contending
with the warring elements of God,&mdash;how terrible
was our situation!
</p>

<p>
Inspired either by the activity of youth, or a
greater dread of perishing, I left my companions some
twenty yards behind me.  In this race for life and
death poor Dick Abbot was failing, and his younger
brother was loth to leave him a single pace behind.
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Manly," I heard him cry, "take time, please;
do you see anything yet, sir&mdash;of the brig, I mean?"
"Not a vestige," said I, turning to wait until
they joined me.
</p>

<p>
The ice was bursting in every direction, and the
waves seemed to boil through the yawning rents in
snowy foam; vast pieces, like bergs, arose from the
water, and were dashed against each other, to sink
into the deep, to arise, and then be dashed together
again.  Add to this the darkness of the gathering
night, the roar of the biting wind, and the dense
murkiness caused by the hail as it swept through
that mighty waste, and the reader may have an
idea of the scene when I paused and looked back for
my two companions.
</p>

<p>
At that moment the ice heaved beneath my feet,
I was thrown forward on my face and almost
stunned.  There was a terrific splitting sound as the
field around us broke into a thousand floes: I found
myself separated from my two friends, upon a
piece of ice about half a mile square, and borne
away with it, despairing and alone, into the mist
and darkness of the stormy night.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap20"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XX.
<br /><br />
ADRIFT ON THE DEAD FLOE.
</h3>

<p>
All was obscurity around me&mdash;a chaos of tumbling
waves, of crashing ice and hissing hail.
</p>

<p>
I shouted wildly, fiercely, as the dying or
despairing alone may shout.
</p>

<p>
A faint response seemed to come through the
drift and the hail that was sowing the ice and
pathless sea; but it might have been fancy, or my
own cry tossed back by the mocking wind.  And
now from time to time I was covered by the icy
<i>spoondrift</i>, as the water which the wind sweeps from
the wave-tops is named by seamen.
</p>

<p>
For a time I felt the impossibility of realizing
the actual horrors of such a situation, and
murmured repeatedly&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Oh, this cannot be reality; if so, it must soon
come to an end, and I shall be dead!"
</p>

<p>
The floe on which I sat surged and rolled heavily,
as it was rasped, dashed against others, and whirled
round in the eddies they made.  On its slippery
surface I was driven hither and thither, even when
seated; and at last, on finding myself among some
large stones which were frozen into the snow, and
which I knew to be a portion of the brig's ballast,
I shuddered with instinctive dread when discovering
that I was adrift on that portion of the ice in which
our dead were buried, and which had lain on her
starboard bow.  Thus I learned that at the moment
of my separation from the Abbots, I had been
within half a mile of the <i>Leda</i>.
</p>

<p>
There was agony in this now useless conviction!
</p>

<p>
"Am I to find a grave here, after all?" was my
thought.
</p>

<p>
If I could live till dawn, the crew of the <i>Leda</i> (if
she, too, survived the night) might see and save
me; but who could live on an ice-floe through so
many freezing hours?
</p>

<p>
After a time the wind lulled, the hail ceased,
the clouds were divided in heaven, and a star or
two shone in its blue vault.  The ice-blocks ceased
to crash against the floe, thus its motion became
steadier, and under the lee of a hummock, I
endeavoured to keep myself as warm as my upper
garments, which were entirely composed of seal-skins,
would enable me.
</p>

<p>
The moon was rising, and its fitful light added to
the chaotic terrors of the scene around me.  To be
alone&mdash;<i>alone</i> upon a floe at midnight, with the open
sea rolling around me!  All seemed over with me
now.  I felt that my sufferings could not last long,
as I should certainly pass away in the heavy slumber
of those who perish by exhaustion and intensity of
cold.  In spite of this horrible thought, I gradually
became torpid.
</p>

<p>
I had been, perhaps, an hour in this situation,
when I seemed suddenly to start to life, as a bank
of vapour close by parted like a crape curtain, and
the moonbeams fell upon the white canvas of a
vessel.  She was a brig&mdash;she was the <i>Leda</i>, under
weigh, and distant from the floe not more than one
hundred yards!
</p>

<p>
She was under sail, with her foreyards aback to
deaden her way, as she was rasping along a lee of
ice-floes and <i>brash</i>, as the smaller fragments are
technically named.  The weather had now become
so calm, that her canvas, which glittered white as
snow in the moonshine, was almost, as the sailors
say, <i>asleep</i>, there being just sufficient wind to keep
it from waking.
</p>

<p>
I endeavoured to shout, but my tongue was paralysed
as if in a nightmare; sobs only came from my
heart, and I thought all sense would leave me, as
the brig, like a spectre, came slowly gliding past.
Again and again I endeavoured to hail her, but in
vain.
</p>

<p>
I rushed to the edge of the floe, at the risk of
slipping off it into the sea.  Then a faint shout
reached my ear, and made my heart throb with joy.
Those on deck could not hear my voice, but they
had seen my figure in the moonlight; and in a few
minutes I beheld a boat shoved off from her, and
heard the cheerful voice of old Hans Peterkin, crying
with his Orkney <i>patois</i>&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Quick, my lads&mdash;lay out on your oars!" as they
pulled through the rack and drift towards me.
</p>

<p>
I was soon dragged on board the boat, and on
reaching the deck of the <i>Leda</i>, fainted, after all I
had undergone, and the joy of escaping a death so
terrible.  The last sounds I remember were the voice
of Hartly welcoming me, and the jarring of the
yards and braces, as the foreyards were filled, and
the brig payed off bravely before the gentle breeze.
</p>

<p>
Of my unfortunate companions, no trace was ever
seen!
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XXI.
<br /><br />
CAPE FAREWELL.
</h3>

<p>
For three days our course was encumbered by masses
of broken ice, which seemed to crowd upon and
follow us; thus the brig was constantly being put
about or thrown in the wind, backing and filling to
avoid the large floes and calves, as those treacherous
pieces of sunken or detached ice which suddenly
rush to the surface are named.  To avoid the lesser
floes, we had often to carry a warp to a large one,
and track along its side.  The cheerful voice of
Hartly might always be heard encouraging the
faint and weary on these occasions.
</p>

<p>
"Now, my lads&mdash;tally on! bowse away upon the
guess-warp!"
</p>

<p>
"Hurrah!" the men would answer, as they pulled
together vigorously.
</p>

<p>
"Once more we are afloat, Jack," said he to me,
on the third morning.  "I began to fear we should
berth all our ship's company in the ice that lay on
the starboard bow; but now we may sit cosily in
the cabin, as of yore, and learn how her head lies by
the <i>tell-tale</i> compass that swings in the skylight."
</p>

<p>
Again at sea, our sick recovered as if by a miracle;
but still many antidotes against scurvy were
requisite before we could haul up for the long voyage
that lay between us and St. John.  I caught a few
fish, and they formed a delicious change for Cuffy's
fricasees of odious blubber, served up half cold in a
greasy mess-kid.
</p>

<p>
Once more there was a reckoning to keep.  For a
few cloudy days we had merely kept a dead one, by
log and compass; but on making a solar observation,
Hartly and Reeves found that they were many
hundred miles eastward of where they expected to
be; and this was a circumstance over which they
had no control.
</p>

<p>
It is well-known that a current which comes down
Davis' Straits eddies round the east coast of
Greenland.  By this we had been borne towards its
western shore with great rapidity.
</p>

<p>
In 1818, the <i>Anne</i>, of Poole, when beset by an
ice-field, was thus drifted at the rate of two hundred
and twenty miles per day!
</p>

<p>
Early on the morning of the fourth day, the sea
was pretty clear of floes; but a dense and dusky
fog-bank came down like a curtain, and seemed to float
upon the water, about twenty miles from us.  We
had suffered considerably in our besetting, and by
concussions among the floes; so, as the morning was
calm and sunny, Hartly had all hands at work,
tarring, painting, and repairing our various damages.
A spare jib-boom was shipped, and it was soon taut
with its heel-rope and jib-guys; our rudder was
finally repaired, and two new staysails were being
bent, when there was a cry of "land" from aloft.
</p>

<p>
"Land in sight!" shouted Hans Peterkin, who
was out on the arm of the fore-topgallant yard,
repairing something.
</p>

<p>
"Lad!&mdash;where?" asked Hartly, snatching his
telescope from the companion.
</p>

<p>
"On the lee quarter, sir."
</p>

<p>
"You must have deuced good eyes, Hans," said
the captain, sweeping along the fog-bank with his
glass; "for nothing like land can I see!"
</p>

<p>
"The bank is rising, sir," replied the Orcadian,
as he sat jauntily astride his lofty perch, and pointed
to the east.  "I see either an island or headland."
</p>

<p>
Even while he spoke, the dense mountain of vapour,
behind which the morning sun was shining, rose
slowly from the surface of the sea, and with the
naked eye we could see, at the far horizon, a low
dark streak, that ended in a bluff or promontory
Hartly sharply closed his telescope.
</p>

<p>
"Luff, Paul&mdash;keep your luff," said he; "lie closer
to the wind, while I prick off our place on the
chart."  He hurried below; but soon returned, saying,
"That is either Cape Farewell, or I am bewitched."
</p>

<p>
"Off the coast of Greenland?" said I.
</p>

<p>
"No, <i>on</i> the coast of Greenland," he replied,
laughing.  "And now, as the ice and current have
driven us so near it in spite of our teeth, we may
as well stand in for the shore, and get some fresh
provisions, before bearing up for Newfoundland."
</p>

<p>
A careful examination of the chart proved that
we had drifted, or been driven (in our endeavours
to avoid the floes) to latitude 59° 48' North, and
were in longitude 43° 54' West of Greenwich,
consequently, the land we saw was undoubtedly Cape
Farewell, a lofty promontory which forms the most
southern extremity of Greenland.
</p>

<p>
With considerable satisfaction we stood in towards
the shore, in the hope of obtaining supplies
from some of the Moravian settlements.
</p>

<p>
About four hours after, some of the natives who
were fishing came about us in their strange boats,
which are made of whalebone covered with seal-skin,
and shaped like a weaver's shuttle, so that they may
be rowed any way.
</p>

<p>
By sunset we were close upon the land, and came
to anchor several miles north of the cape in a little
cove of Nennortalik, or the Isle of Bears, where, as
Reeves said jestingly, we had no <i>groundage</i> to pay
for letting go our cable; and there the wondering
population of the little Moravian colony received us
with acclamation.  The canvas was handed and
most of the crew were allowed to go on shore, with
instructions to return with as much scurvy-grass
as they could collect; for with this herb, like Baffin,
the voyager of old, Hartly proposed to brew
scurvy-beer for his patients.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap22"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XXII.
<br /><br />
THE MUSK-OX.
</h3>

<p>
Rejoicing that we trod on firm land once more,
Paul Reeves, Hans Peterkin, and I set off to shoot
on the great Island of Sermesoak, which is divided
from the mainland of Greenland by the Fin Whale
Strait, while Hartly arranged with the Danish
resident at the village for such supplies of fresh
food as a place so poor could afford.
</p>

<p>
Leaving the Isle of Bears, we ran our boat into
a creek called Cunninghame's Haven, from John
Cunninghame, a Scotsman, who was Admiral of
Denmark, and who, on his return from Davis' Straits, in
1605, appeared off Greenland with three ships, and
carried away some of the natives, whom he
presented to Christian IV., together with a chain
weighing twenty-six ounces, formed of fine silver,
found by him among the rocks at a place still
named Cunninghame's Fiord.
</p>

<p>
With all our anxiety to add to the fresh provisions
on board, we were not without a desire to encounter
some of the bears with which one always associates
the name of Greenland; and ere twenty-four hours
elapsed, I was certainly gratified to the fullest
extent in that way.
</p>

<p>
The people of Sermesoak were then in consternation,
owing to the depredations of a fierce herd of
Bruins which had crossed the strait from the mainland,
and devoured many of their children, dogs, and
reindeer.
</p>

<p>
These bears are as revengeful and subtle as they
are savage.  "Some years ago," says a traveller,
"the crew of a boat belonging to a ship in the
whale-fishery shot at a bear and wounded it.  The
animal immediately uttered the most dreadful howl,
and ran along the ice towards the boat.  Before he
reached it a second shot hit him; this, however,
served but to increase his fury.  He presently swam
to the boat, and in attempting to get on board, placed
one of his fore-feet on the gunnel; but a sailor,
having a hatchet in his hand, cut it off.  The
animal still continued to swim after them, till they
arrived at the ship; several shots were fired at him
which took effect, but on reaching the ship he
ascended to the deck; and the crew having fled into
the shrouds, he was actually pursuing them <i>thither</i>
when a shot laid him lifeless on the deck."
</p>

<p>
Allured by the odour of the seal oil, they had
surrounded and broken into the dwellings of the
natives in herds, and devoured them in their beds;
and numerous stories of these terrible <i>raids</i> were told
to Hans (who knew something of the language)
by the people of Sermesoak, as we set out on our
expedition.
</p>

<p>
We shot several white hares, and consigned them
to a large canvas bag which Hans had slung over
his shoulder.  In our sporting ardour we penetrated
several miles into the country, and in making a
détour to beat up for nobler game, I lost my
companions among the furze-covered rocks of a
ravine.  Dusk was coming on, and, wearied with
halloing, I sat down to look around me.  I was
quite alone and in a strange place, but more safe and
comfortable in every way than when I was alone
on the ice-floe.  Though in a foreign and barbarous
country, this reflection set my mind completely at
ease.
</p>

<p>
A wild and dreary scene lay around me.
</p>

<p>
Mountains piled on mountains of stern rock rose
on every side, covered with snow unmarked by
footstep, track, or road.  No trees were growing there
and no verdure was visible, save some patches of
short grass and moss where the wind had torn the
snow from the rocky surface.  It seemed as if the
icy breath of the Northern Sea, when it swept
through the Fin Whale Strait, destroyed all
vegetable nature; and as for the flowers of spring,
one might as well have looked for them on an
iceberg.
</p>

<p>
Why that country was named the <i>Green</i>land,
Heaven only knows!
</p>

<p>
In 1610, Jonas Pool, a whaling captain, called it
King James' Newland, from James VI. of Scotland;
but that name was soon forgotten.
</p>

<p>
Above me impended a bluff of sullen aspect,
the rifts of which formed the eyrie of myriads of
white sea-gulls and birds like the great Solan goose
of the Scottish isles; and these were whirring,
screaming, and booming on their broad pinions, as
they came home from the shore.
</p>

<p>
As the shadows deepened, even these sounds
ceased, and nothing met the ear but the croak of a
lonely raven which sat on a granite boulder.
</p>

<p>
Far away in distance, down below me, stretched
the headlands which jutted into the deep blue
waters of the Whale Strait&mdash;starting up in fantastic
pinnacles and precipitous ridges, like the towers and
turrets of crumbling castles.  These walls of rock
were black and sombre, though their summits were
crowned by eternal snow.
</p>

<p>
From the mountains the sleet and melting snows
of ages have long since washed away every grain
of earth; hence, no verdure can spring there, and
their rugged fronts present the most harsh and
singular outlines.  The higher ridges are rendered
inaccessible by glaciers; and when the snows melt
from their gloomy lichened fronts, long and silvery
runnels, that seem like threads in the distance,
trickle down the precipices; then winter comes
again, converting these runnels into ice, which splits
and rends the hardest rock to fragments, that roll
with the sound of thunder down the steep glaciers
into the valleys below.
</p>

<p>
Leaning on my gun, I was surveying this wild
and dreary scene, and careless alike of the cold and
the coming night, was lost in reverie, when a sound
aroused me, and on looking up, I saw close by an
animal of strange form, such as I had never seen
before, even in a menagerie.
</p>

<p>
It was larger than a pony, but had singularly
short limbs, which were almost entirely concealed by
the long dark hair that covered all its body, and
reached nearly to the ground.  It had a short tail,
and large crooked horns of powerful aspect, with a
mass of hair like a horse's mane hanging beard-wise
under its throat.
</p>

<p>
A very strange sensation comes over one on
beholding an unknown animal for the first time, and
on this musk-ox&mdash;for such it was&mdash;approaching, with
its large projecting eyes glaring, and while shaking
those formidable horns, by which it can encounter
and slay the bear and walrus, astonishment soon
gave place to alarm, and I regretted more than ever
the absence of my two comrades.
</p>

<p>
The ox was only a pistol-shot distant, so, with
my heart beating quickly&mdash;as I knew not what the
sequel might be&mdash;I levelled my gun, and fired full
at its head.  The animal uttered a bellowing roar,
bounded furiously forward, and fell motionless on its
side.
</p>

<p>
The ball had pierced its brain.
</p>

<p>
With a thousand echoes, the report of my gun
rang among the hills of rock, peak after peak
seeming to catch the sound and toss it from one to the
other, until it died away on the wind that blew
through the Fin Whale Strait.
</p>

<p>
I was not without hope that the sound might
reach Reeves and Hans Peterkin, and guide them
towards me; but I hoped in vain.
</p>

<p>
The ox I had slain was one of the largest of the
Musk species, and might have weighed, perhaps,
seven hundredweight.  It would, I knew, prove a
most acceptable addition to our scanty stores on
board the <i>Leda</i>; moreover, I was not a little vain
of having slain, by a single ball, an animal so large
and so little known by Europeans; but <i>how</i> to get
it conveyed to the brig, or how to guide any of our
crew to the spot where it lay, were puzzling queries.
</p>

<p>
I observed that at the distance of a hundred
yards from it, there rose a steep and rugged rock,
cleft into three singular peaks, so lofty as to be
visible from a great distance.  Conceiving this to be
a sufficient landmark, I reloaded my gun, and
resolved, if possible, to discover Cunninghame's Haven,
where our boat lay.  Without a track, a road, or
native to guide me, I toiled over the steep and rugged
mountains, and through ravines and hollows half
filled with drifted snow, steering my way by the
stars in that direction which I conceived might lead
me to our boat.
</p>

<p>
To enhance the wildness and gloomy grandeur of
the scenery, there now came a wondrous and
fan-shaped light over all the clear cold blue of the
northern sky&mdash;a glorious Aurora Borealis.  This light,
sent by Heaven to cheer the lone denizens of that
frozen wilderness, spread a rich and wavering glow
over all the northern firmament, playing in streaks
or lines that alternately faded away, and resumed
their dazzling brilliance.  These alternations fill
with awe the simple Greenlander, who calls them
the <i>Merry Dancers</i>, and who deems,
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "By the streamers that shoot so bright,<br />
  The spirits are riding the Northern light."<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
At times, the whole sky seemed a blaze of diamond-like
light, tinged with rainbow hues, and in front of
these, the stern rocks, crags, and mountains stood
forth in sharp black outline.  Ever and anon, an
electrical meteor shot athwart the sky, leaving, as
these falling stars always do, a train of momentary
light.
</p>

<p>
Frequently the long streamers played across this
luminous white radiance as if a mighty fan were
being opened and shut, or like the spokes of some
revolving wheel whose axle was at the Pole.  Then
a burst of glory would open in the zenith, and for a
moment every feature in the desolate landscape and
the far-stretching vista of the Whale Strait between
its walls of rocks would be distinctly visible.
</p>

<p>
Alone in that sterile solitude, I gazed upon the
Aurora with emotions of mingled awe and wonder,
turning again and again to the north, as I stumbled
over rocks and frozen snow piles in my efforts to
discover a path that led to Cunninghame's Haven;
so the result was this&mdash;that after more than an hour
of toil, I found that I had been proceeding in a circle,
and came back to the place from whence I had set
out, the bluff with the three pinnacles, at the foot of
which my musk-ox was lying; but there a very
singular scene presented itself, for my property had
already been converted into a banquet by two
denizens of the wilderness.

<h3>
CHAPTER XXIII.
<br /><br />
THE FOUR BEARS.
</h3>

<p>
On first approaching, I imagined that a heap of snow
had fallen from the upper rocks on the dead ox, and
advanced so close that I was only twenty paces from
it before discovering in my supposed snow-heap two
enormous white bears who were rending the body
asunder with their giant claws as one might rend a
chicken, and were devouring it with all the gusto of
an appetite whetted by the frosty air.
</p>

<p>
To add to my dismay at this unexpected rencontre,
I perceived close by, some portions of a human body,
half-devoured&mdash;red, raw, and appalling!
</p>

<p>
A horror came over me, suggesting that this
victim might be either Paul Reeves or Hans Peterkin;
and it was not until some time after, that I was
assured, by fragments of the dress which remained,
that the unfortunate was a Greenlander, whom they
had crushed to death and dragged away.  Pausing
in their banquet, these savage brutes, which were of
enormous size, uttered a hoarse growl, and while
their black nostrils seemed to snuff the breeze, their
deep-set eyes surveyed me ominously.
</p>

<p>
My gun had but a single barrel, thus if I killed
one bear I might fall a prey to the other before there
was time to reload; and if my first shot missed, my
fate would be sealed by both, as they were certain
to crush and devour me between them!
</p>

<p>
Turning, I fairly fled up the rocks towards the
three pinnacles, pursued by the bears, whose
progress was slow, as they were evidently gorged by
their double repast on the dead man and the
musk-ox.
</p>

<p>
Twice I stumbled in my flight, and fell heavily
on my hands and face.  My breath came thickly and
fast, and my long seal-skin boots and overalls, which
were strapped up to a waistbelt, greatly incommoded
me; but love of life and dread of a horrible death are
sharp incentives to exertion and activity; thus I
struggled to gain a cleft in the rocks, from whence
I might turn and shoot down these unwieldy
monsters at vantage and at leisure, while they
trotted laboriously after me, uttering a succession
of deep and menacing growls.
</p>

<p>
I had left them nearly fifty yards behind, while
clambering up the slope, terrified every instant lest by
slipping on the ice-covered rocks I might roll down
under their very paws.  Already I was within
twenty feet of the cleft, beyond which the dazzling
gleam of the Aurora played, when a hoarser growl
saluted my ears; and there&mdash;there&mdash;above me in
the cleft&mdash;in the very haven I was toiling to reach,
appeared a huge brown bear, squatted on his hams,
licking his great red lips, and quietly waiting my
approach!
</p>

<p>
Bewildered by this new enemy, taken in front and
rear, for a moment I remained irresolute, with my
rifle cocked, but not knowing which to shoot before
I met the rest with my weapon clubbed; and now
to add still more to my dismay and peril, a <i>fourth</i>
bear appeared, advancing from another point!
</p>

<p>
The monster in the cleft above me, now began to
utter hoarse and savage roars, in anticipation of my
destruction, which seemed certain; for those northern
bears are so cruel and rapacious, that the female
secludes her cubs (of which she never has more than
two at a litter) from the male, lest he should devour
them during the first month of their blindness.  I
leave the reader to judge of my emotion on finding
my single self opposed to <i>four</i> such antagonists;
for the white Greenland bears are double the size of
those melancholy looking brown brutes whom one
may see dancing in the streets at home, being
generally about twelve feet long.
</p>

<p>
I was blindly desperate, yet my heart did not
entirely fail; and I felt forcibly "how an influence
beyond our control lays its strong hand on every deed
we do, and weaves its iron tissue of necessity."
</p>

<p>
Clambering up the flinty face of the rocks to elude
the three, finding footing where, under circumstances
less exciting, I might have found none, I
ascended resolutely towards the bear which stood in
the cleft snuffing the air, roaring, and showing his
glistening teeth.  Already his hot and fetid breath
began to taint the air about me.  I was within six
feet of him, when, taking an aim there was no
doubt would be true, I fired, and the conical ball
pierced deeply into his vast chest.
</p>

<p>
Maddened by pain, Bruin made a wild bound at
me, but missed his mark, as I crouched low; so he
rolled, dead I suppose, to the bottom of the rocks, in
his progress tumbling over one of those which were
in pursuit of me.  Springing into the cleft he had
so lately occupied, I hastened to reload, and defend
my position, for only one brute at a time could
assail me, unless there were, as I feared, others
among the rocks in my rear.
</p>

<p>
Now what were my emotions on discovering
that in my exertions, while struggling up the rocks,
the strap of my shot-belt had given way, and that
I had <i>lost</i> it, with all my ammunition!
</p>

<p>
A wild perplexity filled my heart, and a cold
perspiration burst over my temples; but at that
moment of desperation a happy thought occurred
to me.
</p>

<p>
Remembering that I had a long clasp-knife,
which opened and shut with a spring, I applied it
in bayonet-fashion to my rifle, and with my
handkerchief lashed it hard and fast to the muzzle and
ramrod head.  This was barely accomplished, when
one of the bears had its fore-paws on the edge of
the rock whereon I stood, and by the light of the
stars I could see his fierce red eyes, his long white
teeth, and enormous claws, while burying my
impromptu bayonet thrice in his great broad breast,
and then the blood flowed darkly over his pure
white coat.  The wounds were not deep enough to
kill him at once, so uttering roar after roar, the
infuriated bear scraped away with his hind feet,
making vigorous but ineffectual efforts to reach me,
till by a furious kick I drove one of his paws off the
ledge of rock.  The other relaxed immediately,
and then Bruin rolled like a great featherbed to the
bottom, about thirty feet below, where he moved
no more.
</p>

<p>
But in a moment a second bear took his place.
Emotion almost exhausted me; but in my confusion
when charging him, fortunately my knife was thrust
into his right eye.  He uttered a hideous cry,
between a bellow of rage and a moan of agony, and
fell down the rocks&mdash;also dead!
</p>

<p>
The weapon had evidently penetrated to the
brain, and killed him.
</p>

<p>
A wild and joyous glow now filled my heart.  It
was a triumphant emotion, a lust for destruction
and revenge, after the terror I had endured; and I
believe that had a whole army of bears appeared, I
should, without fear, have encountered them&mdash;one
by one.
</p>

<p>
Uttering a "hurrah" just as the fourth bear
arrived at my feet, I was about to charge him as I
had done the others when&mdash;oh, terror!&mdash;the knotting
of my handkerchief gave way, and the knife dropped
from the muzzle of my gun, and fell to the bottom
of the rocks.
</p>

<p>
Clubbing the weapon, I rained a torrent of blows
upon the great head of this new assailant, which
seemed the largest and most ferocious of them all,
as he probably had neither partaken of the poor
Greenlander or of that most unlucky musk-ox, the
slaying of which had no doubt brought me into this
perilous predicament; but my blows fell on his
fur-covered skull as harmlessly as they would have
fallen on a bale of cotton.
</p>

<p>
Furiously I struck with butt and barrel at his
broad black nose and great round paws, the deadly
claws of which grasped the rock with the tenacity
of iron hooks.  Bruin uttered neither roar nor other
sound, but concentrating all his energies, drew up
his hams, made a vigorous spring, and in a moment
I was dashed to the ground&mdash;his hot and horrible
breath was in my nostrils and on my face, while his
weight pressed me down as he prepared to hug or
crush me to death.  But now a gun-shot rang
between the rocks of the deep chasm, and I found
myself suddenly freed.  Pierced through the heart
by a single well-aimed ball, the bear rolled over me
dead, a quivering mass of flesh and fur!
</p>

<p>
So severely was I stunned by the shock of Bruin's
attack, and so confused by the whole combat, that
some minutes elapsed before I had sufficient strength
or breath to thank my preserver, to whom I might
as well have spoken in Greek or Choctaw, as he
proved to be a poor Greenlander who had never
heard a word of English before.

<h3>
CHAPTER XXIV.
<br /><br />
WOLMAR FYNBÖE.
</h3>

<p>
After various efforts to make ourselves mutually
understood, he said something in a kind of jargon
which resembled German, and as I had learned that
language at home for commercial rather than
literary purposes, we contrived to converse, though not
with great fluency, using grimaces and signs when
words failed us, which was a circumstance of
frequent occurrence.
</p>

<p>
He informed me that he had been searching for a
friend who came forth to hunt for a musk-ox, which
had been seen in their district, and who he feared
had fallen a victim to its horns or the bear's paws.
</p>

<p>
"I shot the musk-ox," said I; "and as for your
friend, I fear your surmises are only too correct, for
the half-devoured remains of a dead man are lying
at the foot of these rocks just now."
</p>

<p>
He hurried to the base of the precipice, where I
was too exhausted to follow him, and by the sounds
of rage and lamentation which preceded his return,
I was assured that his friend or kinsman had been
the victim of these rapacious brutes.  This
comforted me, however, with the conviction that the
remains were neither those of Paul Reeves nor old
Peterkin, our second mate.
</p>

<p>
But, meantime, where were they?
</p>

<p>
The Greenlander rejoined me, with my shot-belt
and gory knife, which he found among the rocks.
He thanked me for so amply avenging his friend's
death on his destroyers, and proceeded at once to
calculate the value of the four skins and eight hams
of the bears.  He invited me to his house, which he
said was not far off, adding that his name was
Wolmar Fynböe; that he was a merchant who
exported to Europe seal-skins, the horns of the
sea-unicorn, whalebone, and blubber; bartering these,
and the skins of blue and white foxes, hares, and
bears, for knives and guns, shot, tobacco, barley,
beer and brandy, &amp;c.; that he had once been as
far as Kiobenhaven,[*] but did not like the manners of
the <i>kablunaet</i> (foreigners), who were but half men
when compared to the Greenlanders; for national
vanity is a great characteristic of these poor people,
as it is of many others even less civilized.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="footnote">
[*] Copenhagen.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Like the Lapps, he wore a long pelisse of
untanned reindeer skin, having a hood like a friar's
cowl attached thereto, and buttons of walrus teeth.
His hose, boots, and breeches, which were all in
one, were of the same material, but decorated at the
sides by bunches of thongs and tufts of white
bearskin.  Thus, but for his fair complexion, he might
have passed very well for an Esquimau of the
Labrador coast.
</p>

<p>
I gladly committed myself to his guidance.
</p>

<p>
We soon reached his house, a dwelling of singular
aspect, built on the slope of a snow-covered
hill which overlooked the Fin Whale Strait, on the
waters of which the rays of the northern Aurora
were still playing with wondrous beauty; and from
thence he dispatched some of his men to bring home
the remains of his friend, the dead bears, and the
head of the musk-ox.
</p>

<p>
We were received at the door by an old servant,
a woman of fearful aspect, also dressed in skins;
but these were adorned by stripes of red and blue
leather to indicate her sex.  She was aged, and
being of "the <i>old</i> school"&mdash;for there is one there,
even in Greenland&mdash;she was tattooed as completely
as if she had been a denizen of Nootka Sound.
Aloft in her hand, which resembled a crow's talons,
she held a lamp to light us into an inner
apartment, where Wolmar Fynböe introduced me to his
daughters, two girls dressed in skins; but these
were neatly adorned with variously-coloured leather,
especially about the moccassins which encased their
trim legs.  Their dresses were cut low at the neck,
either to reveal its whiteness (for females have
vanity even in that region of ice), or to display
their under garments, which were formed of the
skins of little birds, ingeniously preserved, sewn
together, and worn with the soft feathers next the skin.
</p>

<p>
Wolmar Fynböe was the tallest man in Greenland,
yet he measured only five feet; and though
deemed handsome, he had all the peculiarities of his
race&mdash;to wit, a paunchy figure, a broad flat visage,
of a brown brick-dust colour; small eyes, thick lips,
and coal-black locks, that waved upon his shoulders
like those of a gnome.  Nevertheless, his daughters
Grethe and Alfa had rather regular features, clear
complexions, and long brown hair, their mother
having been a woman of Iceland.
</p>

<p>
They were preparing a supper of <i>grod</i> (Danish),
a species of food made of oats or barley, and
eaten with butter and milk, when their father's
entrance with a <i>stranger</i>&mdash;a being more seldom seen
than mermaids and gnomes, by common report&mdash;startled
them so much, that some time elapsed
before they could resume their occupation, and
swing upon the fire the great pot-stone kettle
containing the aforesaid <i>grod</i> with my assistance&mdash;in
proffering which I won the hearts of all, politeness
to females being rather a rarity on the shore of the
Fin Whale Strait.
</p>

<p>
The large fire burned brightly and cheerily, being
composed of drift-wood; for upon that barren coast,
in addition to the stranded wrecks of Scottish and
Russian whalers, are found at times the spoil of the
Great Gulf Stream, the palmettoes of South America,
and, covered with weeds and barnacles, the vast
logs that whilome cast the shadows of their foliage
on the lovely Bay of Honduras.  By this strange
current the spoils of Virginia and Carolina are also
cast on the shores of Iceland, and by it the
main-mast of H.M.S. <i>Tilbury</i>, which was burned in
Jamaica, was thrown upon the western coast of
Scotland.
</p>

<p>
After having fed so long upon the spoils of the
ice&mdash;the odds and ends of seals and blubber&mdash;I
made a veritable banquet with the worthy merchant
and his two daughters.  Then we had the luxury
of hot brandy-and-water thereafter&mdash;the Ganymede
who served us being, ugh! the old tattooed
woman.
</p>

<p>
I have mentioned that the mansion of Weimar
Fynböe presented a curious aspect, but this arose
from the circumstance of its being (as he informed
me) built from the remains of an old whale-ship of
large dimensions, which had been cast away in the
Fin Whale Strait about one hundred and fifty years
ago.  Her ribs and timbers formed the roof and
uprights of the walls; on these the outer and inner
sheathing were bolted or pegged anew, and filled-in
between with moss and turf.  The lockers in which
her cabin stores had been placed were our seats, the
beds were her berths; the room of the fur-clad
Grethe and Alfa was merely separated from ours
by an old bulkhead, in the centre of which a cabin
door was hinged.  The four stern-windows were
framed into the wall, a luxury, a piece of splendour,
in Greenland, where the casements are usually
formed of the entrails of seals and dolphins dried,
and neatly stitched together.  Some faded charts
were nailed on the wall as pictures.  An old musket
or two, and a pinchbeck watch, were nearly all that
now remained of the spoil found in the ship, which
had been deserted by her crew; but from none of
these relics could her name or country be discerned,
though I supposed her to have been English from
the circumstance of a Bible and little book in that
language having been found in her by the grandfather
of Wolmar Fynböe, who built his house from
her materials.
</p>

<p>
The "little book" Wolmar showed me.  It was a
curious black-letter pamphlet, printed at London in
the time of Charles II., and in Dutch types.  I took
a particular fancy for it, as it contained the relation
of a perilous voyage performed by a ship which
belonged to the Seven United Provinces.
</p>

<p>
Wolmar Fynböe offered to barter it for the horns
of the musk-ox; but I assured him that he was
welcome alike to the entire head, the bears' skins,
and hams to boot.  To this he agreed at once,
conceiving, probably, that one who parted so readily
with spoil did not deserve to possess any; so I
retired with my literary acquisition (the contents of
which I shall give to the reader elsewhere), begging
Wolmar Fynböe to have me summoned betimes in
the morning, as I was most anxious to reach
Cunninghame's Haven, and rejoin my friends on board
the <i>Leda</i>.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XXV.
<br /><br />
ADIEU TO THE REGION OF ICE.
</h3>

<p>
Next morning I was up early, my bed not being
exactly so luxurious as I could have wished; and
there was about everything that overpowering odour
of blubber which pervades a Greenland household.
For breakfast, Grethe brought in a gaily-painted
Muscovite bowl, full of warm milk, and a hot barley-cake,
made by Alfa.  Her father soon after brought
my gun, cleaned and oiled; and then bidding adieu
in rather symbolical language to his daughters, we
set forth into the clear, cold atmosphere of the young
May morning&mdash;for we were now in what is deemed
in kindlier climes the second month of summer&mdash;but
as yet no sun was visible.
</p>

<p>
Far away in distance stretched the Fin Whale
Strait, towards Kalla Fiord, which opens into the
Icy Sea; its broken scenery, its splintered crags, its
lofty bluffs and pinnacles, exhibiting the most
singular combinations of light and shadow in the yellow
blaze of the yet unrisen sun.  The summits seemed
tipped with fire, while the bases which rose sheer
from the still, deep waters of the waveless strait
were dark and sombre as ebony.
</p>

<p>
Waveless it truly was, save where broken by the
knoblike head of a blackfin-whale, as he swam
against the wind, and blew clouds of water into
the air.
</p>

<p>
As we proceeded, I could perceive that Wolmar
Fynböe, though merry and good-humoured, like all
Greenlanders was deeply imbued with superstitions
dark and gloomy as those of the Scandinavian Edda.
Leaning on his hunting-spear, he pointed to a rock
in the strait, saying that his mother's sister Alfa
(from whom he named his youngest daughter) was
wont to see a handsome young merman seated
thereon, every time she came to the beach to gather
shell-fish or dry nets.
</p>

<p>
"A merman!" I reiterated, believing that I had
not heard him correctly.
</p>

<p>
"A merman," continued Fynböe, emphatically.
"His curling beard was green, and his features, like
those of the <i>Innuit</i> (Greenlanders), were as soft and
pleasing as his manner was mild and persuasive.
He took her by the hand, and after their fourth
meeting led her under the sea, where she lived with
him at the bottom of the Fin Whale Strait for a
great many years, and never grew less beautiful,
though she frequently pined for the dwelling of her
mother, whom at times she could behold from the
windows of her watery home, every summer when
the ice-floes floated out to sea, and the young whales
came to play about the headlands in the sunny waves.
</p>

<p>
"One summer came, but the old woman appeared
no more on the slope of the hill; and then Alfa
knew that her sorrowing mother had gone to the
Island of the Dead.
</p>

<p>
"Alfa dwelt with the merman, till one night as
he was sporting about in the moonbeams amid the
waters of the strait, Grön Jette, the wild huntsman,
who once in every year comes over the sea at
midnight out of Denmark, slew him by a blow of his
lance, as he sped with his yelling hounds and fierce
black horses over land and ocean towards the north,
where the bright streamers were dancing.
</p>

<p>
"The spell was thus broken; and the young girl
found herself turned suddenly into an old woman,
seated on the same rock where, twenty years before,
the merman had wooed and won her; but now seven
well-grown children with fish-tails, and hair that was
half green like her husband's and half golden like
her own, were swimming about in the flood before
her, weeping for her return.  So, to rejoin them, she
plunged in and was drowned&mdash;for the spell of the
merman's presence was no longer around her.  Next
day I found her body floating in the strait, and by a
string of crystals round her neck, knew her to be the
sister my mother had lost twenty years before.  We
bore her to the Island of the Dead; and as we use
no coffins, like the red-haired Danes, we heaped up
stones to hide her from view; but a bear swam off
from Sermesoak, tore our gathered heap asunder, and
devoured her!"
</p>

<p>
Wolmar Fynböe rehearsed this strange story with
the utmost good faith; for he was simple enough
to believe that Torngarsück, the God of Greenland&mdash;a
spirit which, though no larger than one's thumb,
at times assumes the form of a gigantic white bear&mdash;dwelt
at the bottom of the Whale Strait, with his
wife the Demon of Evil, guarded by droves of
narwhals and ferocious seals, and surrounded by vast
lamps filled with train-oil, in which the sea-birds
swam by night.
</p>

<p>
With many a strange story of witches, and conflicts
with whales, walruses, and with devils that sailed
through the air and changed themselves into snowdrifts
to overwhelm belated hunters, he beguiled the
way, until we reached Cunninghame's Haven, where
I found Paul Reeves and Hans Peterkin awaiting
me in considerable anxiety, and irresolute whether
to put off for the Bear Isle and report to Hartly
that I had been lost, or to return once more in search
of me.
</p>

<p>
I now gave the honest Greenlander two crown
pieces, as neck amulets for each of his daughters
(among whose descendants they may become heirlooms
for ages), and bidding him farewell, we stepped
into our boat, which was well stocked with game&mdash;a
large white bear, a pile of hares, and several brace
of birds shot by the two mates.  Then we shoved
off to join the <i>Leda</i>, and Wolmar Fynböe, ever and
anon pausing to look after us, slowly ascended
the cliffs, assisted by his harpoon-shaped hunting
spear, and at last disappeared on the path to his
half-barbarous and wholly secluded home.
</p>

<p>
In two hours after, we reached the <i>Leda</i>, which
had her courses loose, a signal for sea.  Our quota
of provisions proved a very acceptable addition to
those obtained by Hartly from the Danish resident.
</p>

<p>
"Bravo, Jack!" said he, as we hoisted the bear on
board, "our victualling department is complete now,
and if this wind holds we shall weigh an hour before
sunset."
</p>

<p>
"But the victualling&mdash;of what does it consist?"
</p>

<p>
"The dainties&mdash;the luxuries of Greenland!"
</p>

<p>
"Indeed," said I, doubtfully.
</p>

<p>
"In exchange for a few hundred seal-skins, and
some kegs of rancid blubber, we have got pickled
bear's flesh, bull-heads, gulls and belugas, salmon-trout,
and reindeer tongues, hares and partridges in
pickle, with a few tubs of whortleberries, preserved
in oil.  We shall have the white bear in the cabin
to ourselves."
</p>

<p>
"Why?"
</p>

<p>
"Sailors won't eat white bear hams?"
</p>

<p>
"But why?"
</p>

<p>
"They assert that the flesh makes their hair
grey.  We have also a cask of sorrel preserved in
blubber."
</p>

<p>
"Ugh! of course; but for what purpose?"
</p>

<p>
"As a preservative against scurvy.  And now up
blue-peter, man the windlass, and heave short on the
anchor!"
</p>

<p>
We sailed an hour before sunset; and ere the pale
white moon rose from the sea, the jagged pinnacles
of Sermesoak and the stormy bluff of Cape Farewell
were melting into the brilliant sky astern, while
our sailors sang cheerily as they hoisted the working
anchor on board, unbent the chain-cable and stowed
it in the tier.  The month being May we had the
light of the sun nearly all night, though in the
daytime he only rises thirty-three degrees above
the horizon.
</p>

<p>
However, we lit our binnacle lamps when he set,
the sails were trimmed for a south-west course, and
now we fairly bore away into the mighty ocean, and
bade adieu for ever to the REGION OF ICE.

<h3>
CHAPTER XXVI.
<br /><br />
A SHARK.
</h3>

<p>
For the fourth time during our rambling voyage,
the <i>Leda</i> was again free and under sail upon the blue
and boundless sea.
</p>

<p>
I cannot describe the emotions of joy with which,
after our recent long imprisonment amid the waste
of ice we gazed upon its buoyant ripples shining in
the sun of May.  Its broad vast bosom of resplendent
blue&mdash;a blue so indicative of immensity&mdash;that
spread far away beyond the dim horizon, flecked with
tiny floes of ice, seemed as the mirror wherein we
could trace the future.
</p>

<p>
It was freedom, it was the high road to our homes,
to sunshine and the genial south.  Everything
was set that would draw&mdash;royals, flying jib, and
studding-sails, as we bore on with a breeze,
which, though keen, cold, and cutting, enabled us
soon to leave the clime of frost and suffering, bears
and icebergs far astern.
</p>

<p>
On the second day we passed a ship waterlogged
and dismasted, battered, and abandoned.  Her boats,
bulwarks, and everything had been swept from her
decks.  We bore down upon her, but there was no
sign of life on board, so we hauled our wind again
and left her to drift, where she would no doubt prove
a prize, on the sterile coast of Greenland.
</p>

<p>
One day a shark followed us with singular pertinacity,
eluding every shot we fired at his black
dorsal fin from our rifles and sealing guns, till Hans
Peterkin, who was skilful in the use of the harpoon,
evidently wounded the monster by a well-directed
blow over our stern quarter, after which our enemy
disappeared.  Old Hans exulted considerably in his
victory, but awoke that night in the midst of a
frightful dream, and alarmed all his shipmates by
crying out that a shark was devouring him.
</p>

<p>
"Take care, Hans," grumbled Tom Hammer, as he
turned in his hammock, annoyed on being roused
from a sound sleep, "don't be falling overboard, for
it is my belief that Jack Shark is in the dead water
astern yet, looking out for his revenge."
</p>

<p>
This passed as a joke at the time, but next day it
had a singular sequel.
</p>

<p>
We were almost becalmed.  From being light and
variable, the wind had nearly died away.  The sea
was smooth as if oil covered all its surface; the listless
canvas hung asleep, or flapped heavily as the masts
swayed to and fro, the reef points pattering, as the
<i>Leda</i> rolled lazily on the long glassy ridges that
swelled up and shone in the meridian sun.
</p>

<p>
Amid the general apathy which such a state of
matters produces on board of a ship, we were roused
by the cry of "a dolphin alongside;" and though
these fish are generally met in droves, when the
waves are breaking and the wind blowing fresh, one
was seen rising and sinking, as if sporting in the
sunshine.
</p>

<p>
Immediately Hans appeared on the bowsprit,
armed with his Orkney harpoon, a long spear pointed
with barbed iron.  Rapidly he bent the line to the
foreganger of his weapon, and grasping it, with a
handful of slack in his right hand, he slid under the
bowsprit, and along the martingale stays which are
stretched taut to the end of the jib-boom.  Clasping
the vertical spar of the martingale with his left
arm, he took a steady aim at the dolphin, and
launched his harpoon with all his strength.
</p>

<p>
The stroke was followed by a shout from the
crew, who crowded into the bows and forerigging,
for poor Hans had overstruck himself, and after
swinging violently round the martingale, fell
into the sea, missing the dolphin, which instantly
disappeared.
</p>

<p>
"My dream&mdash;oh, my dream!" cried old Hans in
terror, as he rose floundering and sputtering to the
surface.
</p>

<p>
Then came the appalling cry of "A shark! a
shark!" and in the very place where the dolphin
sank, the short crooked fin of this great monster of
the deep was seen making straight towards Hans,
who, though an expert swimmer, a hard-a-weather
salt, accustomed to all the hardships and terrors of
Ultima Thule and his native Orcades, was struggling
wildly for life, having got entangled in the slack line
of his harpoon.
</p>

<p>
"Captain Hartly&mdash;man overboard! a rope&mdash;a rope!"
</p>

<p>
"Cut away the life-buoy!"
</p>

<p>
"Lower away the stern-boat!"
</p>

<p>
Such were the cries on every hand, while the
current soon swept Peterkin past the brig, till he
was nearly fifty yards astern.
</p>

<p>
Old Hans uttered a cry of despair, echoed by a
groan from all, and sank!
</p>

<p>
Regardless of the shark, which was then double
the distance of Hans from us, Hartly, who had
rushed on deck at the first alarm, with the rapidity
of thought, threw off his coat, knotted a line round
his waist, lowered himself into the mainchains, and
joining the palms of his hands together in the
cut-water fashion of a diver, urging the while his agile
body by a sharp push from the chain-plate, sprang
into the sea, and vanished amid the ripples.  Then
in half minute or less he reappeared with Hans,
whose grey locks he grasped firmly, as he cast
upward a glance of mingled hope and terror&mdash;hope of
aid from his crew, and terror of the monster, which
was shooting towards them; for though the ring of
Mother Jensdochter was to save him from drowning,
the good dame omitted all mention of sea-lawyers.
</p>

<p>
"Down with the stern-boat!" cried Reeves.
</p>

<p>
In a moment the falls were cast loose and the
boat was lowered from the davits, manned, and
shoved off with a rapidity which nothing but the
discipline of the crew and their love for Hartly
could have ensured!  Save those in the boat, all
held their breath&mdash;all were paralysed by the scene,
and our complete inability to aid or to protect our
friends.  However, the splashing of the half-drowned
Hans somewhat scared the monster, and
kept him off.
</p>

<p>
The boat soon reached the spot; they were
drawn on board, and just in time, for the shark's
nose was close to Hans' heels, while a hearty hurrah
greeted him and his gallant preserver.
</p>

<p>
Ere the boat was again dangling at the stern
davits, the shark, which had now recovered his
surprise and the alarm Hans' splashing had
occasioned him, was seen darting furiously to and
fro in search of a victim; and but for the celerity of
our boat's crew, one or other must have perished in
his horrible jaws.  Though the shark has rarely the
power to bite a man in two, he can strip the flesh
from his body in such a manner, that death is sure
to follow.
</p>

<p>
The wind freshened after this, and the ship's
course was resumed; but as night came on, the
studdingsails and royals were taken in.  Hans
appeared in very low spirits after his recent
adventure, so Hartly excused him from deck duty for
that night.  Then, as we sat over our grog in the
cabin, the deck being in charge of Tom Hammer,
Hartly said&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"By the bye, Jack, you said something of finding
an old printed yarn about a shipwreck in Skipper
Fynböe's house in Greenland."
</p>

<p>
"Yes&mdash;a queer old story it seems."
</p>

<p>
"Let us have it, then; read it aloud.  Cuffy, trim
the lamps; bring another case-bottle from the
locker, and shut the cabin door.  Pass word for
Mr. Reeves and Hans Peterkin to step down&mdash;Mr. Manly
is about to spin us a yarn."
</p>

<p>
I soon produced my little story-book, of which
(as it was an authentic narrative) I shall give the
exact title; though I prefer to rehearse the contents
in my own manner, as the language and spelling of
its author are somewhat quaint and antiquated.
</p>

<p>
It was called "The Wonderfull and Tragical!
Relation of a Voyage from the Indies, printed at
the Black Raven, in Duck Lane, A.D. 1684."
</p>

<p>
The substance thereof was as follows.

<h3>
CHAPTER XXVII.
<br /><br />
THE FATAL VOYAGE OF THE HEER VAN ESTELL.
</h3>

<p>
It was in the month of August, 1670, that the barque
<i>De Ruyter</i>, bearing the flag of the Seven United
Provinces (then under their High Mightinesses the
States General) and named after Michael Adrian de
Ruyter, Admiral of Holland&mdash;the same valiant
mariner who beat the English, burned Chatham, and
bombarded Tilbury&mdash;left the port of Pernambuco,
in Peru, for Rotterdam, tacking carefully to avoid
the shoals and rocks which made the Portuguese of
old name it the "Mouth of Hell"&mdash;<i>Inferno-bocca</i>&mdash;hence
its present corrupted name.
</p>

<p>
She was manned by Captain Koningsmarke and
sixteen seamen; she carried four brass guns, and
had her stern decorated by the lions, spotted sable
and gules, which form the arms of Rotterdam.  Her
mate was an Englishman named Carpinger, a brave
and skilful seaman.
</p>

<p>
As passengers, she had the Heer Van Estell, his
wife Gudule, their two little children, Erasmus and
Cornelius, with Dame Trüdchen, their faithful old
nurse.  The Heer was a native of the Low Countries,
who, after a long residence in the Dutch colony at
Brazil, had amassed a magnificent fortune, and risen
to be a Director of the Company of the Great
Indies, a dignity which no one could attain unless
he vested twelve thousand guilders in the old stock.
Now, having amassed all the wealth he deemed
desirable, with his wife and children&mdash;little
curly-haired Erasmus, whom he had named after the
great philosopher of Rotterdam (towards whose
statue in the Bürger-platz he gave a thousand
rix-dollars), and chubby little Cornelius, whom he had
named after Cornelius de Witt, who, with his
brother, was so barbarously assassinated by William
of Orange (and afterwards of England)&mdash;he was
returning to his native city to spend his days in
peace and quiet, with the three beings whom he
loved most on earth.
</p>

<p>
The day was cloudless and clear, the wind was
fair, but light, and while the bark, with all her
canvas set, from her flying-jib to her spanker,
and with the colours of the Seven Provinces flying
at her gaff-peak, passed in safety the flat sandbanks
of St. Antonio, and that long reef which receives the
full force of the sea, and guards the town of Recife,
the tall and portly Heer, with his beautiful wife and
chubby little ones beside him, sat in a cushioned
chair on the warm deck, enjoying a long pipe of
tobacco with all the ease and complacency that became
a wealthy Hollander and Director of the Great
India Company.
</p>

<p>
Without any emotion, save joy that he was returning,
he saw the hill of Olinda, the tall slender
spires of the town, and the grim batteries of Cinco
Pontas, melt in the distance astern, as the <i>De
Ruyter</i> bore away into the Western Ocean.
</p>

<p>
For more than a month the voyage was delightful
and prosperous; but adverse winds came anon, and
storms too; and Captain Koningsmarke was blown
out of his course; moreover, he lost his reckoning,
as the sky remained obscured by clouds, and for
weeks both quadrant and sextant were used in vain.
</p>

<p>
His anxiety and that of the Heer became great,
for provisions were becoming scarce&mdash;so much so
that, ere long, all on board received but a scanty
allowance.  Then Van Estell and Dame Gudule
beheld with secret agony the roses fading from the
cheeks of their children, their pretty faces becoming
blanched, and their once round forms attenuated.
</p>

<p>
Week after week rolled anxiously, mournfully
away!
</p>

<p>
Still the winds were adverse, and still the <i>De
Ruyter</i> tacked and tacked again, like the fabled
ship of Vanderdecken, but without meeting a craft
that might assist them, till at last there fell a
death-like calm upon the sea; and then, for many, many
days under a hot sun, and in the breathless nights
that followed, the helpless vessel lay like a log, with
her blocks and cordage rattling, and her loose
canvas flapping until it was frittered and frayed on
the blistering yards and masts, while the sea chafed
her rusting chain-plates and the pitch boiled from
her planking&mdash;yet "she lay so that, for several weeks,
they could scarcely tell whether they were forwarded
a league's space."
</p>

<p>
And now a deadly pest broke out on board&mdash;a
malignant fever, which covered its victims with
livid blotches, like the spotted lions, gules and sable,
on the ship's stern; and among those who perished
were Koningsmarke, the captain, and eight of his
crew.  They were thrown overboard, and for days
their bodies remained in sight, with fishes sporting
about them, and obscene birds of the sea lighting on
them, as they floated on its still and waveless
surface.
</p>

<p>
Provisions were now dealt out more sparingly
than ever.  Strong men grew wan, and gaunt, and
feeble; for as their strength failed and hope faded,
so did their spirit die within them; and then even
the most superstitious ceased to <i>whistle</i> for wind.
</p>

<p>
At last they were reduced to a half biscuit and
single morsel of meat per day; the latter failed, and
then the half biscuit; and now they looked grimly
and terribly in each other's hollow visages and
bloodshot eyes, while wondering what was to become of
them, for although lines had long hung overboard,
the sea had refused to yield them fish.
</p>

<p>
"To wait with hope is nothing, but to wait with
DESPAIR is worse than death!"
</p>

<p>
So did the Heer Van Estell wait, and his wife
Gudule&mdash;now no longer the beautiful Gudule, for
she was wan, wasted, and sinking, having given her
pittance of food for several days to sustain her little
ones.  All his wealth, all the riches acquired by
years of prudence in the Indies, would the unhappy
Van Estell have given gladly to purchase a single
biscuit, to sustain for one day more the lives of
those he loved so well.
</p>

<p>
At last little Erasmus and Cornelius died, passing
away without pain or a murmur, having become
of late too weak even to weep for food.
</p>

<p>
They passed away, and the Heer and his wife
remained by the pretty corpses as if transformed
to stone!
</p>

<p>
Four days passed after this&mdash;still no food&mdash;no
hope&mdash;no wind in the air, no ship upon the sea!
</p>

<p>
Gudule could not consent to cast her dead children
into its mighty depth; but anon she repented of it
bitterly, for the eight seamen who remained, after
a long conference on the forecastle, and frequently
casting glances aft towards the cabin&mdash;glances like
those of wolves&mdash;came in a body, and demanded
that the dead children should be surrendered to
them as <i>food</i>!
</p>

<p>
The entreaties and tears of the parents were vain.
The Heer (now shorn of his strength) and his
miserable helpmate were thrust into their cabin,
while the wasted bodies of their children were borne
away and laid on the drum of the capstan, where
they were cut to pieces by the cook's knife, and
then devoured raw.  Hunger seemed to make the
sailors insane, and able to overcome all aversion for
food so unnatural; but whether it was that they
ate immoderately, or that with satiety came a
horror of their meal, I know not, but they were
immediately assailed by a dreadful sickness, which
left their bodies weaker than ever.
</p>

<p>
Gudule lay in a stupor on her bed, but the Heer
loaded his pistols, though scarcely knowing for
what purpose; and exerting all his strength, he
contrived to burst open the cabin door and stagger
on deck, when the crew, whom the hunger of another
day assailed again, had just concluded the last of a
second dreadful banquet&mdash;a banquet on his children!
</p>

<p>
On the capstan there lay the head of one.  It
had the fair curly locks of little Erasmus.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, madness and agony!" groaned the miserable
Van Estell, as he took it in his tremulous
hands, kissed it tenderly thrice, and slowly and
solemnly dropped it into the glassy sea.
</p>

<p>
He could not weep&mdash;his hot dry eyes refused a
tear, but groans burst from his overcharged breast
and parched lips, and he swooned on the deck.
There he lay, and so another day passed.  When
he recovered it was about the time of midnight, and
a full round moon was shining on that now
neglected ship of death and of despair.
</p>

<p>
The atmosphere was mild and warm.
</p>

<p>
The Heer stole into the cabin, and saw that his
poor, sad, childless wife lay very still and
motionless.  Tremblingly he drew near, lest she might be
dead; for then he had resolved to cast her and
himself into the sea, lest her fair form might also
be devoured by the madmen on deck.  But she was
in a soft sleep, dreaming, perhaps, that her lost little
ones were alive, and seated by her side in a palm
grove of Peru, listening to the voice of the
campanero, or sweet bell-bird of Brazil.  The deep
slumber that follows long hours of mental and
bodily suffering had fallen upon her.
</p>

<p>
The poor man wept and kissed her tenderly, but
at that moment the mate, George Carpinger,
entered, and roughly ordered him to come forward to
the capstan head, where he and his comrades were
deliberating on what was to be done next.
</p>

<p>
Heer Van Estell assured himself that his pistols
were still in his pocket, that they were primed and
loaded, and then he obeyed.  As these nine men
stood round the capstan, they resembled spectres
rather than human beings, when the cold lustre of
the moon fell on their pallid visages and bloodshot
eyes that glared wildly from out their sunken sockets.
</p>

<p>
Eleven persons were still on board, namely, the
Heer, his wife and servant, the mate, and seven
seamen; it was evident that one must be sacrificed
to prolong the existence of the rest, and mentally
they resolved that whoever became the victim,
should be cooked, lest the flesh might sicken them
again......

CHAPTER XXVIII.
<br /><br />
THE FATAL VOYAGE&mdash;HOW THEY CAST LOTS.
</h3>

<p>
"I am aware," says the author of <i>Antonina</i>, "of
the tendency in some readers to denounce truth itself
as improbable, unless their own personal experience
has borne witness to it."  In this spirit, some may
denounce the fatalities of the Heer's voyage as
improbabilities, though the hideous circumstance of
human beings in extremity of hunger destroying
each other for food, has been too well and too
terribly established in many instances&mdash;such as the
wreck of the French frigate <i>Medusa</i>; when the
British frigate <i>Nautilus</i> was lost on a solitary rock
in the Mediterranean; during the famine on board
the American ship <i>Peggy</i>; and on many other occasions.
</p>

<p>
But to resume our little quarto.
</p>

<p>
The mate conducted the Heer Van Estell to the
capstan, where the starving seamen stood in a silent
group, and then he informed him in a hoarse
whisper&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"That unless they contrived a means of furnishing
themselves with food, they must all die of
starvation; it was impossible for them to subsist
for another day.  That there were eleven persons on
board, and they had come to the resolution of
determining by lot who should die that the rest
might live."
</p>

<p>
"<i>Eleven</i> on board!" reiterated the Heer, faintly,
for his poor wife Grudule was one of these.
</p>

<p>
"Eleven," added a seaman named Adrian Crudelius,
with a wild glare in his eye; "if one dies,
ten may live.  Bring your wife on deck, sir; she
must take her chance with the rest.  There must
be no distinction here."
</p>

<p>
"Nay," said George Carpinger, "we may excuse
her presence, and so spare her some of this horror;
but her husband shall draw for her."
</p>

<p>
"Sirs," replied the poor Heer, "I thank you.
Even here she finds the privileges of her sex accorded
her."
</p>

<p>
Then with tremulous hands the mate tore a sheet
of paper into eleven pieces, and numbered them
from <i>one</i> to <i>eleven</i>.  He folded and placed them in
his hat.  It was then agreed that he who drew
number <i>one</i> was to die, and that he who drew
number <i>two</i> was to be the executioner.  After
shaking the fatal pieces of paper, amid a silence that
was awful&mdash;the silence of horror&mdash;for food or want,
death or life, were on the issue, every glassy eye
was fixed, each nether jaw relaxed, while with hot
and feverish hands that trembled, they drew forth
their lots&mdash;the Heer taking two in succession.  He
opened them hastily, smote his forehead, uttered a
wailing cry, and reeled against the capstan.
</p>

<p>
He had drawn numbers "one" and "two," so it
was the lot of him to die, and by the hand of
Grudule, or <i>vice versâ</i>!
</p>

<p>
The unhappy seamen had scarcely foreseen a
chance so terrible as this.  Carpinger urged that
the wife should be spared, or that lots should be
cast once more; but those who by risking their
fate had escaped death, were loth to tempt it again,
and with sullen murmurs declined.  Propping himself
against the capstan, the unfortunate Van Estell
summoned all his energies, and thus addressed them:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"My good companions in misery, you have seen
our sorrow and despair for the loss of our dear little
children; and though I know that death would be
a relief and refuge to my poor Grudule, neither she
nor I can perish by the other's hand.  Thus I offer
myself freely and willingly as the victim and
sacrifice.  When I am dead, I charge you&mdash;I pray you
be kind unto her.  Conduct her to her friends, her
home, her country, and be assured that if ever you
are happy enough to see the waters of the Maese,
and the old spires of Rotterdam, she will have
wealth enough to reward you all.  May Heaven
bless you!  Gudule, farewell&mdash;my poor Gudule!"
</p>

<p>
At these words he drew a pistol from his pocket,
shot himself through the head, and fell flat on the
deck.  Some appeared stunned by the whole affair,
but two threw themselves upon the yet quivering
body like wild animals, and sucked up the blood
that oozed from it.
</p>

<p>
In the weird light of the moon, that bloody deck,
that silent group and fallen corpse, presented an
awful scene to Gudule Van Estell, who tottered from
her cabin, being roused by the sound of the pistol;
but now Carpinger the mate, Adrian Crudelius, and
her old nurse, bore her back into the cabin, and
fastened the door to prevent her seeing the dreadful
scene that was sure to ensue, when the famished
men, in their voracity and fury, almost tore the
clothes from the body of the Heer, being rendered
more mad than ever by the contents of a single
case-bottle of Geneva which had been discovered.  They
hewed the body to pieces, cast its head into the sea,
and again the horrible repast commenced&mdash;a repast
which rendered two raving mad, for with loud yells
they sprang overboard and disappeared.
</p>

<p>
All the rest became insane, save the mate and
Adrian Crudelius, who endeavoured to control their
extravagance.  One proposed to scuttle the ship, or
set her on fire, that all might perish together;
another raved and blasphemed Heaven for withholding
the wind; a third denounced the craft as
being under a spell, and thus fixed to one part of
the sea, from whence she would never stir till her
timbers rotted and her planks opened; and all, save
the mate, were unanimous that next time the wife
of the Heer, upon whom one of the lots had fallen,
should perish for their sustenance if a sail came not
in sight.
</p>

<p>
That day passed as others had done; the glassy
sea without a ripple, the hot sun overhead, the sails
flapping against the masts; the banner of the Seven
Provinces, inverted as a sign of distress, hanging
listlessly downward from the gaff-peak; the sky
without a cloud, the horizon without a sail, and the
hearts of the cannibals on board the <i>De Ruyter</i> without hope!
</p>

<p>
Gudule Van Estell was still surviving.  The kind
mate had caught a couple of mice; these he gave to
the nurse, who cooked them in secret for her mistress
and herself.  But now, towards evening, four of the
crew, who were bereft of reason, approached her
cabin door, and were attempting to force it open,
for the purpose of dragging her to the capstan head,
when George Carpinger, armed with a cutlass, rushed
forward, and drove them back.
</p>

<p>
They soon procured arms, and howling like wild
animals, attacked him, staggering the while like
drunken men with weakness.  Crudelius now joined
the mate, and there ensued a conflict in which two
were slain, and their bodies were cast overboard by
the survivors, who were already so glutted by their
horrible food as to have no desire for more.
</p>

<p>
By the noon of the next day, all had perished by
exhaustion, save the mate and the Dame Van Estell.
</p>

<p>
Night was coming on, and the poor solitary
seaman was sitting on the windlass in a species of
stupor, when an unusual coolness in the atmosphere
roused his attention, and, with a sailor's instinct, he
felt the coming breeze.
</p>

<p>
First there came a gentle catspaw upon the
darkening water, then a ripple, and now a whitening
of the wave-tops at a distance.  He stretched his
tremulous hands towards them, and wept in joy!
</p>

<p>
Anon, clouds came banking up in dense masses to
leeward, and rain&mdash;blessed rain! began to fall, while
the wind of heaven blew the long neglected rigging
out in bands, and filled the flapping sails.
</p>

<p>
A brace of lazy gulls suddenly appeared wheeling
about; and a bird&mdash;a land bird&mdash;perched on the
end of the studding-sail boom alongside.
</p>

<p>
The haggard eyes of Carpinger swept the horizon,
and saw afar off a spark, which he at first supposed
to be a star, but, ere long, discovered to be a light;
yet whether it shone on board of a ship, or on the
shore, he knew not; so he lashed the helm, and rushing
to the lifts and braces, strove to trim the sails and
shape the vessel's course towards it.
</p>

<p>
The bunting began to shake at the gaff-peak; ere
long it floated out upon the wind, while a wake
whitened astern, a bubble rose under the bows,
and the <i>De Ruyter</i> walked through the water as
of yore.
</p>

<p>
The breeze continued, and next morning she was
close in upon a bleak, rugged, and mountainous
coast, which proved to be the Lizard Point in
Cornwall, the most southern promontory of
England.*
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="footnote">
* It must be borne in mind that the mouth of the Channel
was less frequented by shipping in 1670, than now.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
George Carpinger had the Dame Van Estell
conveyed ashore in the stern-boat, together with a
casket of valuable jewels; and the <i>De Ruyter</i>, after
drifting about the coast, escaping the Cornish
wreckers, who deemed a wreck "a Godsend," was
taken into Plymouth and sold.  Gudule Van Estell
was afterwards conveyed to Rotterdam, where she
found herself one of the wealthiest widows in the
city; and as a reward to George Carpinger for
defending her life so valiantly in the fated <i>De
Ruyter</i>, she bestowed her hand and guilders upon
him.
</p>

<p>
"They lived long and happily together; and he
died Burgomaster of Rotterdam in 1720, when Anne
was Queen of Britain."
</p>

<p class="t3">
&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"So ends this story," said I.
</p>

<p>
Hartly filled his glass of grog, and emptied it in
silence.
</p>

<p>
Then I could perceive that the perusal of the
history of this fatal voyage had a most unpleasant
effect upon all who heard it, for Reeves, Hartly,
and Hans Peterkin, frequently recurred to it
afterwards.
</p>

<p>
"That little black pamphlet came from a wrecked
ship," said Hartly, one day&mdash;"'a fated craft'&mdash;I
can't help wishing you had never brought it on
board, Jack."
</p>

<p>
"Why?" I asked.
</p>

<p>
"It is such a devil of a horse-marine yarn about
these Dutchmen eating each other."
</p>

<p>
"How?"
</p>

<p>
"I always think about it."
</p>

<p>
"I can easily put it out of existence by stuffing
it under a kettle in the cook's galley; it may aid
Cuffy in cooking the dinner."
</p>

<p>
"No, no," said he, hastily, "that would be worse."
</p>

<p>
"In what way?"
</p>

<p>
"I don't know," said he, thoughtfully; "but such
things are like the Flying Dutchman's letters, which
must neither be taken or refused when the wind
blows them on board."
</p>

<p>
Some days after this, Hartly lost his ring&mdash;the
ring given him by old Mother Jensdochter&mdash;the
amulet which, until that moment, he had never been
without.  It was torn from his hand while assisting
to haul the maintack on board, and dropped over
the gunnel.
</p>

<p>
This trivial event, and the story of the <i>De Ruyter</i>,
together with the past evils of our voyage, affected
Hartly and Reeves more seriously than I could have
imagined.  From the cabin, Cuffy Snowball soon
carried the vague fears forward among the seamen.
Hans Peterkin began to shake his white head
ominously, for old mariners have, they know not
why or how, strange instincts and presentiments;
so our crew, without any just reason, became more
than usually solicitous about their duties, and
anxious for the termination of the voyage.

<h3>
CHAPTER XXIX.
<br /><br />
ADVENTURE WITH A WHALE.
</h3>

<p>
Next day the wind veered due west, and we trimmed
the <i>Leda</i>, to lie close to it, making long tacks to the
southward, as we had been driven so far to the
north-east.
</p>

<p>
Hartly and I were leaning over the weather-quarter,
chatting and gazing listlessly at the white
water that bubbled like a flooded mill-race under
the brig's counter, while Mother Cary's chickens
came tripping lightly after us, when suddenly a
huge whale (like a ship's hull, bottom uppermost)
rose from the waves close by us, with the water
pouring in torrents from its dusky and shining
sides.  Its appearance was so sudden and alarming,
that I started back; but Hartly laughed, saying,
</p>

<p>
"Don't mind him, Jack; he is not coming on
board."
</p>

<p>
For a full minute he floated in the water, keeping
pace with the brig, to the great admiration of our
old Orkney whaleman, Hans, and then sank slowly
down&mdash;down far below.  We could see his vast bulk
shining as he passed <i>under</i> us, and came up on our
other side, so close that he almost grazed the copper
of the <i>Leda</i>.
</p>

<p>
This monster of the deep was nearly as large,
at least as long, as the brig, and his aspect was
calculated to inspire awe in those who were less
familiar than we now were with the denizens of the
sea.
</p>

<p>
He was a common whale, and the head being, as
usual, out of all proportion, was one-third the entire
size of the fish, while the eyes were no larger than
those of an ox.  The smooth and slippery skin,
from which the foam dripped, was mottled; and it&mdash;or
<i>he</i>, as we named him&mdash;swam not as whales
generally do, <i>against</i> the wind, but with us.
</p>

<p>
Our friend was evidently in a playful mood, as he
repeatedly rose and sank, plunged and surged up on
each side of the <i>Leda</i> alternately, and twice grazed
our rudder.
</p>

<p>
"He smells the blubber and sealskins aboard,
sir," said Hans Peterkin, "and they make him
frolicsome, you see."
</p>

<p>
"Look out, sir!" added Reeves, who was in the
mainchains; "by Jove, he'll be foul of us in his next
gambol!"
</p>

<p>
"And we may have our rudder unshipped&mdash;I
don't like this at all," replied Hartly.  "Cuffy, bring
me a sealing-gun, with powder and a handful of
slugs."
</p>

<p>
In half a minute Hartly stood in the boat at the
stern davits, with the long gun loaded and charged
with ten square junks of lead, each larger than a rifle
ball.  Then, just as the whale, for the fifth or sixth
time rose under the stern, he fired.
</p>

<p>
The whole charge entered one of the great
spiracles, or blow-holes, which are situated in the
middle of the head, about sixteen feet from the nose,
and through which this fish can spout to a vast
height when wounded or annoyed.  The moment the
gun was fired, our whale sunk like a stone.
</p>

<p>
"There he goes, for ever I hope!" cried Hartly.
</p>

<p>
"We have not seen the last of him, sir," said
old Hans, as he got astride the boom of the
fore-and-aft mainsail in his excitement to see the whale
again; "he has a long way to go <i>down</i>, before he'll
come up again.  Why, Lord love you, sir, I have
known them in the sound of Yell, when struck by a
harpoon, descend head-foremost for eight hundred
fathoms, (at the rate of eight knots an hour, till the
line in the bowpost smoked, ay, blazed with friction,)
and then come up with their jawbones broken, by
running foul of a rock at the bottom.  That one
has gone down fully four hundred fathoms."
</p>

<p>
"How do you know, Hans?"
</p>

<p>
"By the eddy&mdash;he'll be up to <i>blow</i>, directly."
</p>

<p>
"Where?" said I.
</p>

<p>
"On our weather beam, I think.  See! there are
the bubbles of his blowing already!"
</p>

<p>
Hans was right; even while he spoke, the
whale rose to the surface, about fifty yards from
us, and from his blow-holes shot a vast spout of
water streaked with blood into the air, and then it
pattered like rain as it fell into the sea.  After
lashing the water furiously with his tail till it boiled in
foam around him, and the air above became filled
with vapour, he threw himself into a <i>perpendicular</i>
position, and stood for a moment like a pillar, from
the sea.
</p>

<p>
It was a strange and exciting scene!
</p>

<p>
He now flapped his mighty flukes, which were
perhaps thirty feet apart, till they cracked like a
gigantic whip, and then sank from our gaze in a
deep eddy, around which the concentric waves
heaved and broke for a considerable time; but we
saw him no more.
</p>

<p>
"Well, Hans," said I, "how do you like this
adventure?"
</p>

<p>
"Not much, Master Manly," replied the old
Scotsman, shaking his white hairs; "'cause you see,
sir, when a whale takes to dancing about on his
nose in this fashion, after lashing the water with his
flukes, a <i>storm</i> is sure to follow.  A whale knows
better than a human creature when a close-reefed
topsail breeze is coming, by a pricking pain that comes
over their bodies, and so, after dancing about as that
fellow did, they run right away from that quarter
of the sea to another.  I have known o' this many
times, when I was a wee bairn at home in Whalsoe.
I'll stake a trifle we have our topgallant yards on
deck before the sun sets."
</p>

<p>
And old Hans proved correct.

<h3>
CHAPTER XXX.
<br /><br />
LOSS OF THE "LEDA."
</h3>

<p>
On the night after our adventure with the whale
I had turned in to bed betimes; but was roused
about two in the morning by the noise made by
Hammer, our carpenter, Cuffy Snowball, and others
battening the deadlights of the stern windows.  At
the same moment I became sensible of the unusual
motion of the vessel, of the tremendous din that
reigned on deck, and of the furious manner in which
my cot, the brass cabin lamp, and the tell-tale
compass swung about.
</p>

<p>
"What is the matter?" I asked, starting up,
while the prophecy of Hans flashed on my memory.
</p>

<p>
"Matter, sir! faith, if you were on deck you
would soon find out!" was the somewhat impatient
response of Tom Hammer, who was drenched to
the skin.
</p>

<p>
"Is it blowing hard?" said I.
</p>

<p>
"'Twill nebber blow harder, Massa Tanly, till
him blows himself right out," grinned Cuffy
Snowball.
</p>

<p>
"A regular hurricane! the brig is almost under
bare poles, and we sound the pumps every half-hour,"
added Hammer, who seemed indignant at the
soundness of my past slumber.
</p>

<p>
On hearing all this, I leaped out, dressed myself,
and hurried on deck.
</p>

<p>
A wild gale, in short, a tempest, was roaring
through the rigging and straining the shrouds of
the <i>Leda</i>; she lurched and pitched heavily, as she
rushed through mountains of seething foam; for
amid the black obscurity on all sides we could see
its whiteness, and the snowy surf, which was torn
by the wind from the wave-crests, and swept, like
smoke, along the sea.
</p>

<p>
The brig was driving right before the wind, under
a foresail, foretopsail, and fore and aft mainsail,
all closely reefed.  Everything was done that might
render her snug.  The deadlights had barely been
shipped before she was struck by a wave which
buried her in the black trough of the sea&mdash;tore her
stern-boat from the iron davits, and swept it away
like a leaf shred from a twig.
</p>

<p>
Hans and Paul Reeves were at the wheel.  Hartly
stood by them pale and excited, as I could perceive
by the glimmering lights of the binnacle.  All hands
were on deck, and muffled in their glazed storm-jackets
and dripping sou'-westers, so they seemed
as drenched as if they had come up from the bottom
of the sea.
</p>

<p>
"Take care of yourself, Jack&mdash;take care!" cried
my friend; "every sea she ships sweeps something
off the deck, and we have already lost one man
from the fore-yardarm."
</p>

<p>
"Good Heavens&mdash;when?"
</p>

<p>
"About an hour ago&mdash;poor Bill Bradley!"
</p>

<p>
I grasped one of the mainshrouds, for the deck
was so slippery, the gusts of wind so fierce, and the
force of the seas, which broke ever and anon across
the brig, so overwhelming, that I could never have
kept afoot for a moment without some support.
</p>

<p>
On, on careered the <i>Leda</i>, through wind and
waves&mdash;on through whitening foam and tossing
wrack&mdash;on through drenching rain, darkness, and
obscurity, with the storm roaring and whistling amid
her straining spars and rigging, while she groaned in
every timber, and seemed to quiver to her backbone,
as the ponderous waves pursued and burst upon her.
</p>

<p>
Once or twice the gloom around us was varied by
sheets of lightning which gleamed luridly at the far
horizon; and then for an instant the black waves
seemed to be washing <i>against</i> the reddened sky.
Elsewhere to the northward, when the black flying
scud was torn asunder in heaven, we saw the long
flickering rods of the "merry dancers" playing
athwart the sky.  Then the crape-like rent would
close, and all again became pitchy darkness.  The
sea which tore away our quarter-boat had started
the sternpost.  Tom Hammer and his mates rushed
to sound the pumps, and reported that "the water
in the well had risen <i>four feet</i>!"
</p>

<p>
Hoarse orders were bellowed by Hartly through
his trumpet, and the clank of the pumps rang
incessantly, for it was evident she had sprung a leak
somewhere aft, the <i>clear</i> water having replaced the
bilge; so a fresh gang was required every quarter of
an hour.  Here was a place in which I could make
myself useful, and take my "spell" with the rest;
and where, though the dread of perishing was strong
in my heart, I worked hard but mechanically, like
one in a terrible dream.
</p>

<p>
Hammer, with all the hands that could be spared
from the deck, hurried below, but soon reappeared,
to announce&mdash;why I know not&mdash;that to get at the
leak was impossible!
</p>

<p>
"Do we gain upon her?" was the constant
question of those who toiled at the pumps; but Hammer
was too full of hopelessness to reply; so for hours
the monotonous clanking went on, till the chains
and leathers of the pumps became almost useless,
and then the water rose rapidly in both the fore and
after hold!
</p>

<p>
We threw our large anchors and carronades overboard
to lighten her by the head; but without much
avail.  Pale and composed&mdash;resolute yet anxious&mdash;poor
Hartly had stood by the pumps, encouraging
us by his voice and example.  He was, however, sad
and gloomy.  That the loss of his <i>ring</i> affected him
was evident.  How strong and yet how weak is the
mind of man!
</p>

<p>
The water continued to rise rapidly, though we
toiled till our knees and arms ached; grey dawn
began to brighten in the east, but there was no
symptom of the storm abating.
</p>

<p>
"If she ships one sea more, such as that which
struck our quarter," said Hartly, "she will founder!"
</p>

<p>
The words were scarcely uttered, when a mighty
mountain of black water reared up like an arching
cliff, fringed by foam, came hissing and roaring
towards us, and burst in thundering volume on our
decks, sweeping poor Tom Hammer the carpenter,
another seaman, and all the spare booms, spars,
buckets, and everything that previous waves had
left, overboard&mdash;starting the longboat from its
lashings, and dashing it with such violence against
the larboard bulwarks, that a vast breach was made
in them.  The gang at the pumps were all tumbled
in a heap into the starboard scuppers, and returned
to their work with difficulty.  The iron sling of the
mainyard gave way at the same moment, and the
spar with the handed sail fell heavily with all their
gear into the sea.
</p>

<p>
Under this shock the Leda literally <i>stood still</i>, as
if paralysed in her forward progress.
</p>

<p>
Another fatal volume burst upon her quarter, and
<i>then</i>, alas! she began to settle down into the trough
of the sea.  She had lost all her buoyancy and was
sinking!  Her rudder was torn away&mdash;the stern
frame shattered, and so she filled with perilous
rapidity.
</p>

<p>
"Clear away the longboat, Reeves&mdash;unship the
compass in the binnacle," ordered Hartly; "Hans,
get up a beaker of water, a bag of bread&mdash;in oars
and blankets&mdash;we must quit instantly and shove
off!"
</p>

<p>
"In such a sea as this?" asked Reeves, with wildness
in his eye, as he clung to a belaying pin.  "No
boat can live&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Ay, Paul, even in such a sea as this; we must
quit the ship, or sink with her.  Stand by, my lads,
and throw her head to the wind."
</p>

<p>
"The foremast will go like a reed&mdash;but see&mdash;the
wind has already done what you wish."
</p>

<p>
The loss of her rudder had rendered the <i>Leda</i> (her
chain plates were now in the water) unmanageable,
but, with the promptitude and decision of brave and
desperate hearts, some of our men hurried to the
braces, to strive and keep the vessel's head to
windward, while others got the longboat cleared of all
that endless <i>débris</i> and rubbish which usually
accumulate there during a voyage&mdash;launched it, and by
fending, with no small exertion of skill and strength,
prevented it from being dashed to pieces against the
side of the foundering <i>Leda</i>.  A cask of water was
thrown in, also the binnacle compass, which,
unfortunately, was broken during the confusion.  The
oars were luckily lashed to the thwarts; the mast,
yard, sail, and rudder were also there, and we
prepared at once to leave.
</p>

<p>
Wild though the wind, the atmosphere was dense
and full of vapour and obscurity; the mingled rain
and surf were so blinding, that one could scarcely
see one's hand outstretched at arm's length.  To
keep our feet in such a howling tempest was almost
impossible; thus in passing forward or aft, we were
obliged to drag ourselves along by clutching belaying
pins, cleats, and ring-bolts, while many of us
were severely injured by pieces of broken wreck that
floated about the deck, and were dashed to and fro
by the waves.
</p>

<p>
Two or three of our men were stunned, and on
falling overboard were seen no more; but in less
than three minutes after the longboat was launched,
we had all left the ship&mdash;Hartly being the last to
do so&mdash;and to the number of fourteen in all
(including Paul Reeves, Hans Peterkin, Cuffy
Snowball, and me), committed ourselves to the mercy of
the sea and storm, in that small craft, which was
tossed like a cork upon the billows.
</p>

<p>
For a time the boat was rasped so furiously against
the side of the brig, that all our united strength was
requisite to get under her shattered stern, and fairly
shove off.  We worked in silence&mdash;the silence of
black desperation!
</p>

<p>
But on falling astern of the sinking brig, the boat
became exposed still more to the fury of the sea.
</p>

<p>
"Pull her round," cried Hartly; "keep her bow
to the break of the sea, or we shall be swamped.
Pull to windward of the <i>Leda</i>!"
</p>

<p>
As we did so, a single wave nearly filled the boat,
and we had nothing for it but to bear away before
the roaring blast.
</p>

<p>
Through the black drift we could see the brig,
from which we were only a few yards distant, sinking
deeper and deeper; at last the waves rolled in
fierce tumult over her deck; still not a word escaped
us.  Our hearts were too full for utterance; but a
pang of sorrow and dismay thrilled them when the
poor little <i>Leda</i>, with her masts still standing, went
down into the waste of waters and disappeared for
ever!
</p>

<p>
Hartly now took off his sou'-wester, and briefly
told us "to be of good heart, for God would be sure
to protect us."
</p>

<p>
All present untied and took off their hats, and
listened to him in silence, though he could scarcely
be heard amid the wild fury of the gale.  Then
Paul Reeves, who pulled the bow oar, shouted&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Three cheers, my lads, for our captain!"
</p>

<p>
And they gave them with all the heartier will
that he was now as poor as themselves, for all that
Hartly possessed in the world had gone down with
the <i>Leda</i>, as she was not insured.  To keep the
boat from being swamped, with incredible difficulty
we now stepped her mast, hoisted a little of the
sail, and bore away before the wind; but when we
were in the <i>trough</i> of the sea, it flapped against the
mast, and the next instant, when we rode on the
<i>summit</i> of a wave, the wind almost tore it to shreds.
Then the wild water bubbled over her stern, often
immersing the steersman to his ears, and obliging
us incessantly to bale with our hats; but the
increasing light of dawn, and an evidence of some
abatement in the tempest, encouraged us to
persevere in our efforts to save our lives; and so we
struggled manfully with the warring elements.

<h3>
CHAPTER XXXI.
<br /><br />
THE CRY.
</h3>

<p>
The wind and sea went down together as day
brightened on the cheerless scene.  After the night
we had passed, how grimly pale and wan our faces
seemed in the cold grey dawn of morning!
</p>

<p>
This catastrophe occurred in the middle of May,
when we were about three hundred miles from
St. John, our destination.  Our compass was broken,
but we continued to steer south-west and by west,
as well as we could determine.
</p>

<p>
The gale having abated, we hoisted the sail to the
masthead, shipped our oars, and after receiving
about a tablespoonful of rum per man, endeavoured
to make the best of our way towards Newfoundland,
in the hope of being picked up, ere long, by one of
the many outward or homeward bound traders.
</p>

<p>
When day was fully in, we swept the sea with
anxious eyes, but not a sail was visible!
</p>

<p>
Cast thus helplessly on the wide ocean, with a
few biscuits, a small beaker of fresh water, and a
gallon keg of rum, at a distance of three hundred
miles from land, our prospects were gloomy in the
extreme; and amid them all, the horrible story of
the <i>De Ruyter</i>, and similar miseries endured by
those of whom I had heard and read in such
situations, haunted me.
</p>

<p>
Exertion warmed us: we now got our clothing
wrung out and dried, the boat thoroughly baled,
and by midday we were as comfortable as men so
circumstanced might be.  Cuffy, who had saved his
violin, the only article of property he ever possessed,
now proceeded to enliven us, as he had often done
before, by singing a negro melody, to his own
accompaniment; yet this was but ghastly mirth
at best.
</p>

<p>
Our biscuits being soaked by the brine, excited a
thirst which we were without the means of allaying.
Moreover, the <i>idea</i> of being upon allowance in itself
excites a thirsty craving; thus by the noon of the
second day, the water in the beaker was nearly
consumed, and we had no hope now but for rain.
</p>

<p>
I believe some hours elapsed before we were
fully aware, or had realized a true sense of our
dreadful situation.
</p>

<p>
How shall I describe the days that passed&mdash;and
how the nights?  Morning after morning only
dawned to raise our hopes of success; and these
faded as the day wore on; and then the nights were
dark monotonous hours of bitterness and despair.
</p>

<p>
Yet they were the short nights of May; and it
must be borne in mind that however warm they are
upon the land, and in more temperate latitudes, they
were cold and chilly when passed in an open boat,
upon the mighty Atlantic.  The evening of the
fourth day deepened, and still not a sail was in sight.
About nine o'clock, one of our forlorn party, whose
clothing was thinner than the rest, and who had
suffered much from hunger and exposure, died in the
bottom of the boat, and we silently committed his
body to the deep.
</p>

<p>
There were neither prayer nor funeral service, but
we all stood up, and uncovered our heads, while
Hans and a seaman launched the poor fellow into
the sea.
</p>

<p>
Our last drop of water was now expended, for it
had been poured between the parched lips of this
sufferer, in vain.
</p>

<p>
Our bread we dared scarcely eat, even in the
morsels in which it was doled out, lest it might
excite that awful thirst which we had no liquid to
assuage, and which the summer sun, when blazing
over our heads at noon, rendered worse by a thousand
degrees, making us long for night, when the moist
dew would fall on our parched lips and arid visages;
then night made us long for day, in the hope of
seeing a sail, as we were in terror lest one should
pass us unseen; and I am assured that more than
one must have done so.
</p>

<p>
Amid his own bodily misery, poor Hartly frequently
reproached himself for having, as he said,
"lured me from a quiet occupation into a career so
fatal and disastrous."
</p>

<p>
The older seamen sought to encourage us by
relating how often they had been wrecked, and yet
had escaped death.
</p>

<p>
"I remember," said Hans Peterkin, "when the
<i>Brenda</i>, a bark of Kirkwall, was wrecked on her
voyage from Jamaica.  The night was rough, and
we were under close-reefed topsails, when a sea
struck her, and unshipped her rudder, just as she
sprang a leak.  All hands were ordered to the
pumps, and to the thrumming of a sail; but the
loss of the rudder hove her dead in the wind's eye,
so her mainmast went by the board, bringing with
it the fore and mizen topmasts, making her a
useless wreck in a moment.  I was washed
overboard; but there was no time to look after me, so
I rode on the mainmast all night.  When day broke
there was no ship to be seen&mdash;she must have
foundered in the dark.  Three days and two nights
I rode upon that shattered mast, till a Spanish
schooner, bound for Rio, picked me up; yet I never
lost heart, shipmates, for I knew I should be saved."
</p>

<p>
"How?" said Reeves.
</p>

<p>
"Because we have a saying among us in Orkney,
that he who eats of the dulse of Guiodin,* and
drinks of the well of Kildingie, will escape
everything but the <i>Black Death</i>; and many a time I
have eaten of one and drunk of the other."
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="footnote">
* The creek of Odin, in Stronza.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
On the fifth day another man died, and was
committed to the deep.  No one stood up this time, we
were becoming either too weak or too callous.
</p>

<p>
"Water&mdash;water," sighed Paul Reeves; "when
ashore, I will never drink aught but pure spring
water again."
</p>

<p>
"Bide ye, messmate, and dinna gut a swimming
fish; or, as we say in Orkney, cut up nae herrings
till ye have them in your net.  When you are
ashore!&mdash;ashore indeed&mdash;when shall we ever see the
shore?"
</p>

<p>
Even the strong mind of the hardy Hans was
wandering now.  The wind kept tolerably fair,
and though by alternate spells at the oars we toiled
day and night to add to the speed of our sail, we
had no means of ascertaining the distance we ran;
and now the pangs of hunger were alternately
maddening or paralyzing, but they were trivial when
compared with those of thirst.  By skilfully striking
with his oar, Hans contrived to kill four petrels
when they came tripping by close to our boat.  Since
the days of Clusius and Pliny, tradition has foolishly
made these poor birds the precursors of a storm; but
the elements had done their worst upon us, so we
cared not.  They were soon plucked and demolished.
</p>

<p>
We found them very fat and nutritious, as the
whole genus of petrels have a singular facility for
creating and for spouting pure oil from their bills
in defence of themselves and their eggs if molested;
and of this oil they can produce plenty, as they
feed on blubber and fish.  The quantity in them
astonished all but Hans Peterkin, who had been
wont to harry the nests of the skua, as the petrel is
named in his native isles, and who told me that
whales were often discovered in the Firth of Westra
and the Sound of Yell by the flocks that followed
in the hope of a gorge of blubber.
</p>

<p>
"My father was drowned by a <i>skua</i>," said he.
</p>

<p>
"Drowned&mdash;how, by a skua?"
</p>

<p>
"Ay, for so they called the petrels in Orkney
once, and so they call them in Faroe now."
</p>

<p>
"But how was he drowned?" asked Hartly.
</p>

<p>
"He was a bold fellow who could climb the steep
rocks that overhung the most furious sea, to get
eggs and catch the petrels <i>asleep</i> if possible; for the
skua or fulmar supply us with feathers for our beds,
medicine in illness, and oil for our lamps.  My
mother used to make the whole bird a candle by
passing through its mouth a wick, which the fat of
the body fed.  My father, Magnus Peterkin, was,
I have said, a bold fellow, though he wore a <i>glain
neidr</i>, or adder-gem, an old amulet of the Druid
days, and believed that while it hung at his neck
he was safe.  On a stormy night he swung himself
over a rock in Pomona to pull some petrels out of
their holes, but one squirted a billful of salt oil
right into his eyes&mdash;-just as I might a quid&mdash;which
so confused him, that he quitted hold of the rope,
fell upon the rocks three hundred feet below, and
perished miserably&mdash;poor man!"
</p>

<p>
The fifth night was calm and beautiful&mdash;too calm
for us, as the wind had almost died away, and a
clear moonlight was shining on the silent sea, when
a singular and startling event occurred&mdash;one that
filled us with vague terror and awe.
</p>

<p>
Six of us, faint, worn, and half-asleep, were
tugging monotonously at our oars; four slept in
the bottom of the boat, and Reeves was steering by
a star, while honest Cuffy Snowball, whose native
good-humour and cheerfulness even the horrors of
our situation could not repress, was playing sweetly
on his violin, and, to keep our spirits from sinking,
sang a negro song which he had picked up during
the years of his slavery in South Carolina&mdash;and
sung it while his tongue clove to the roof of his
mouth with thirst.  I leave the reader to judge
how in such a time and place the soft melody and
grotesque pathos of a hackneyed popular air sounded
in the ears of the starving and the dying!
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "All round de leetle farm I wandered,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I was young;<br />
  Den my 'appy days I squandered,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many de songs I sung.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">

</p>

<p class="poem">

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Far from de old folks at home!"<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Alas, it was grotesquely horrible!
</p>

<p>
The calmness of the night, the sickness of my
heart, the weakness of my limbs, and the sweetness
of the violin as its notes floated far over the moonlit
sea, together with the monotonous sound of the
oars, made me fall into a waking doze&mdash;yet I still
tugged mechanically on, though dreaming.
</p>

<p>
At times I imagined that I was in a dense fog
off the harbour mouth of St. John.  I heard the
booming of the fog-guns from the battery on the
mountains, though they sounded faint and far off.
Then followed the welcome voice of the gunner on
the low rocky point of Fort Amherst, challenging as
usual&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"What ship is that?"
</p>

<p>
I strove to answer as we ran in through the
Narrows, but my tongue refused its office.
</p>

<p>
Again, I was at my desk, engrossing in giant
ledgers, with the snorting voice of old Uriah Skrew
grating on my ear.  Anon I was in my father's
rose-covered villa at Peckham&mdash;in London, amid
the roar and gaiety of its streets&mdash;its evening bustle
and lights&mdash;in the theatre&mdash;at the opera&mdash;galloping
out of town on the Derby-day.  Then I was in a
silent forest&mdash;but lo!
</p>

<p>
My dreams were broken by a shriek which made
us all start as if electrified&mdash;the oarsmen at the
oars, the sleepers at the bottom of the boat.  Cuffy
dropped his violin, and Reeves his tiller, as we all
sprang up, looked in each other's sunken eyes, and
on the glassy sea, that rippled in flat immensity far
away in the moonlight.
</p>

<p>
"What is it&mdash;where did it come from?" we all
gasped.
</p>

<p>
But none could answer correctly.
</p>

<p>
"It seemed to rise from the sea, far away on the
starboard bow," said Reeves.
</p>

<p>
"<i>The starboard bow!</i>" repeated Hartly, shuddering.
</p>

<p>
We gazed intently around us, and though one of
our men insisted that he could see a large figure
like that of a man swimming towards us in the
moonlit water, the rest could discern nothing.
</p>

<p>
This supernatural cry or sound seemed to belong
neither to earth nor heaven; it rent the air and
penetrated to our inner hearts; its cadence, too,
was horrible, and unlike anything we had ever
heard before.  Its source occasioned us endless
surmise, and we never discovered it; but the
circumstance affected us all variously, and for a time
we forgot our thirst, our hunger, and our danger, in
the mystery and vague fear it occasioned.
</p>

<p>
That it could be given, as one surmised, by a
drowning seaman who had escaped from some
wreck, was impossible, for under the brilliant moon
of the early May night, the whole sea was visible to
us as at noonday.  Hans of Orkney declared it to
be a spirit of the sea, a water-bull, or the ghost of a
man, whom we had unwittingly deserted in the
foundering wreck.  Cuffy moaned out that it was
a warning from the Obi man.  An Irish batman
muttered something about a Banshee, but poor
Hartly was too careless now, or too desponding, to
suggest anything, and remained silent.
</p>

<p>
I can scarcely conceive that this cry, so strange,
so wild and thrilling&mdash;so appalling to those who
were in such a solemn and terrible situation&mdash;and
which was heard by us all at the same moment, was
the combined effect of imagination; but whether it
was some phenomenon&mdash;a sound brought through
the air from a vast distance, by some unknown
cause&mdash;the echo of a crime committed elsewhere, or a
jarring of the elements that affected our over-strained
organs of hearing, I know not.
</p>

<p>
I merely relate the event as it occurred; but
never, while life remains, shall I forget the
bewildering and terrifying effect of that appalling
shriek, when it rang in our ears, across the otherwise
silent sea on that most mournful night.

<p><a id="chap32"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XXXII.
<br /><br />
THE TWELFTH DAY.
</h3>

<p>
The sixth day dawned as the wind freshened and
the waning moon went down in clouds; it dawned
upon an angry sea, a leaden sky, and with a cold
breeze that bore no ship&mdash;no hope of release towards
us.
</p>

<p>
On, this day two more of our men, who had been
lying in a torpid state for three hours, died, and
were cast overboard.  We were completely callous
now.  About eleven in the forenoon, Hans Peterkin,
who was steering, suddenly uttered a hoarse cry.
</p>

<p>
"See&mdash;see!" he exclaimed, pointing a-head, while
glaring with haggard eyes; "a sail&mdash;a sail!  Thanks
be to God," he added, pulling off his fur cap, "we
are saved!"
</p>

<p>
We that were rowing turned, and those who were
dozing between the thwarts sprang up; and there
sure enough, hull down about eighteen miles off, we
saw a large ship under a cloud of dark canvas, which
had evidently been wet by rain overnight, running
close-hauled upon the starboard tack, and going with
great speed through the water.
</p>

<p>
Oh the ecstasy of this sight!
</p>

<p>
We trimmed our little sail anew; we hoisted all
our neck-ties at the mast-head, as a signal; we pulled
with the strength of madmen&mdash;madmen, who were
dying and despairing&mdash;towards her; but she saw us
not, (I dare not say that her crew <i>heeded</i> not.)
Though for a time we seemed to gain upon her, the
wind freshened so much that she was soon out of
sight; and once more, after all our prayers, our
longings, and our joy, we were left alone upon the sullen
sea&mdash;alone amid emotions too terrible to delineate,
for hope and life went with her!
</p>

<p>
Some of our strongest men wrung their hands and
wept.  Three days after this, those who had
restrained the maddening desire to drink of the sea,
now gave loose to their burning thirst, and heedless
of the appeals of Hartly and the warnings of
Peterkin, plunged their wasted hands in the brine,
and drank it in great quantities.
</p>

<p>
The sequel soon followed&mdash;a delirium and insanity
which rapidly became infectious.
</p>

<p>
All were soon raving.  Hartly talked of his dead
wife&mdash;of their little ones, and the green churchyard,
where they lay under an old yew-tree; then of his
lost ship, and the ring of the Iceland witch.
</p>

<p>
Hans sang Orkney songs in a guttural dialect&mdash;half
Scottish and half Norse; and believed himself
to be whaling in the Pentland Firth, and Sound of
Yell.  Paul Reeves sat with a serious but fatuous
aspect, writing an imaginary log with his fingers on
the boat-thwart; Cuffy played scraps of negro-melodies
on his violin; and believed himself to be
in his caboose, cooking a sumptuous dinner for those
in the cabin.
</p>

<p>
Some raved of rich repasts, and with idiot joy
enumerated the viands that smoked before them, or
the cool draughts of spring water that gurgled over
mossy rocks and under broad green leaves in shady
woods&mdash;and of luscious fruit that grew in ripe
clusters, but which they strove to reach in vain, as,
like the gushing spring, it always eluded them.  In
pursuit of one of these illusions, poor Hans Peterkin
fell overboard, and, without an effort to save himself,
sank like a stone.  Alas! the holy well of Kildingie
and the blessed dulse of Guiodin, availed him nothing now!
</p>

<p>
At last we ceased to row, for the strongest among
us "caught crabs" from time to time, and had the
oars twitched out of their hands by the sea, for we
were helplessly and hopelessly worn out.
</p>

<p>
The haggard features of some became rigid; the
black fur of fever gathered upon their cracked lips;
and their wild, sunken, and blood-shot eyes assumed
a snaky glare.  Their wasted forms seemed to
dwindle before me; then they grew and dwindled
again like a species of phantasmagoria, as I sat
bewildered and half torpid among them; then a lurch
of the boat would throw some of them off the
thwarts motionless and dead!
</p>

<p>
On the <i>Twelfth</i> day after we had abandoned the
<i>Leda</i>, there remained in the boat only four alive,
including Hartly, Reeves, a seaman named Jones, and
myself.  All the rest had been thrown overboard in
succession as they died&mdash;even poor Cuffy Snowball,
clutching his violin to the last.
</p>

<p>
In their delirium some had been very violent&mdash;proposing
to scuttle the boat; others threw the oars
overboard and unclasped their knives to slay their
messmates.  One sprang into the sea, with a husky
cry, and ended his miseries at once.
</p>

<p>
Grim and fearful as they were, I thought the
calm aspect of those who died was to be envied.
They seemed so free from every ill and storm that
might assail them, while those who yet lived and
lingered were the most helpless of human beings.
I know not why or how it was that so many strong
and hardy men perished, while I survived.
</p>

<p>
Reeves, Hartly, and Jones the sailor, lay prostrate
in the bottom of the boat; and at times I knew not
whether they were alive or dead, save by an occasional
spasm that twitched their features, or a quivering
in their limbs.  After a time even these symptoms
of existence ceased.
</p>

<p>
I felt the slumber of long exhaustion stealing over
me.  Lest the boat might capsize in a squall, I
remember having just sense and strength sufficient
to enable me to let go the halyard, and lower the
sail, or rather, let it fall by its own weight, when I
sank down in the stern sheets, and must have lain
there for hours.
</p>

<p>
A drizzling rain refreshed me, and when I awoke,
the silver moon, was shining on the sea.
</p>

<p>
Another night had descended upon us!
</p>

<p>
I baled out the boat with a hat, for the forms of
my passive companions were half-covered by water.
As I did so, I thought Hartly spoke&mdash;at least, that
his white and bloodless lips moved; but this might
be fancy.  My mind was a chaos of gloom, misery,
and terrible forebodings.
</p>

<p>
Anxious to learn whether life yet lingered in my
friend, or whether I was quite alone&mdash;the last
man&mdash;with the dead upon that silent midnight sea, I
stooped close to Hartly; but at that moment the
boat gave a sudden lurch, which threw me violently
among the three bodies.  In falling, my head struck
against one of the thwarts, and happily I became
senseless.

<h3>
CHAPTER XXXIII.
<br /><br />
WHAT FOLLOWED.
</h3>

<p>
After that night a long time of dreamy stupor
seemed to elapse, before any distinct sense of
existence forced itself upon me.  Then I seemed to
wake from a heavy slumber (which had frequently
been crowded by dreadful images), and found myself
in bed, and in what appeared to be a little
state-room that opened off a ship's cabin.
</p>

<p>
The roof seemed close and near my eyes; but the
bed was soft and screened by green curtains, which
hung upon a brass rod.  The little panelled
apartment had shelves crammed with books and bundles
of papers; a gun, a cutlass, and telescope were hung
on hooks; and from the deck above, a bull's-eye
threw the sun's rays vertically down upon me.  I
saw all these details at a glance, but believed them
to be portions of a dream&mdash;that I was still tossing
in the open boat, with my dead or dying companions
rolling about in the bilge-water below the thwarts&mdash;so
my last thoughts of loneliness, of despair, and
coming death recurred to me in all their bitterness.
</p>

<p>
Gradually, however, the warmth and softness of
the couch on which I lay became too confirmed and
real to be doubted; and now a hot but soothing
liquid, like mulled wine, was poured between my
lips.  I drank deeply, and not until the draught
was ended did I open my heavy eyes, and again
look round me, fearing to dispel the delicious
illusion of imbibing a liquid, for the wild agonies
of unassuaged thirst were still in my memory.
</p>

<p>
A jolly and bluff-looking seaman, well tanned by
exposure to the weather, and well whiskered; squat
in figure, merry in eye, and hearty in voice, wearing
a straw hat and pea-jacket, with a handsome gold
ring to secure the ends of his black silk neck-tie,
was holding back the green curtain, and surveying
me with some solicitude of manner.
</p>

<p>
"How do you feel yourself now, my lad?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"Weak&mdash;giddy&mdash;ill&mdash;Hartly&mdash;Bob Hartly, keep
her head to the break of the sea, or we shall be
swamped," said I, incoherently.
</p>

<p>
"By Jove, I thought the mulled port would bring
you up with a round turn and make you speak if
nothing else would."
</p>

<p>
"Where am I?" said I, partially recovering again.
</p>

<p>
"On board ship at last."
</p>

<p>
"Which&mdash;what ship?"
</p>

<p>
"The barque <i>Princess</i> of London."
</p>

<p>
"Thank God&mdash;thank God!" I exclaimed; but
though my breast heaved with wild emotions of joy,
not a tear would come, for even that fount of
tenderness seemed dried up within me.
</p>

<p>
"We picked you up when in an awful plight, my
poor fellow!  Your boat was half full of water, with
two dead bodies washing about in it."
</p>

<p>
"Two!"
</p>

<p>
"Yes&mdash;two, and you were lying in the stern-sheets
looking as pale and as stiff as the others.
We were just about to send you over to leeward
with a cold shot at your heels, when, fortunately,
some signs of life escaped you."
</p>

<p>
"And you, sir&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Am the master of this craft&mdash;Captain John
Baylis&mdash;I think you won't forget the name," he
added, smiling.
</p>

<p>
"Forget it!  Oh, sir, how shall I ever forget it?"
I groaned.  "But Hartly&mdash;poor Bob Hartly!"
</p>

<p>
"Who was he?"
</p>

<p>
"<i>Was</i>&mdash;is he then dead?" I exclaimed.
</p>

<p>
"I cannot say, until you tell me more."
</p>

<p>
"He was Master of the <i>Leda</i>, and my dear friend.
She foundered in a tempest, and those you found
in the longboat were the last of twenty-five stout
fellows who sailed in her from St. John's,
Newfoundland, on the 17th of March."
</p>

<p>
"Is he about my size; with very dark whiskers
and short curly hair?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes."
</p>

<p>
"Then he is getting on famously, and lies in my
chief mate's berth&mdash;but you must not speak any
more at present, try to sleep; a little time, and I
will be with you again."
</p>

<p>
This was joyous intelligence!
</p>

<p>
In short, I learned by degrees that Hartly and I
were the sole survivors of the crew of the <i>Leda</i>.
Paul Reeves and Jones the seaman had been found
dead in the long boat by the crew of the barque, who
buried them in blankets, each with a heavy shot at
their heels.  After this they scuttled the boat, as the
sight of her suggested unpleasant ideas.
</p>

<p>
The vessel which picked us up proved to be the
barque <i>Princess</i>, a stately Blackwaller of sixteen
hundred tons register, Captain John Baylis, from
Quebec, bound for the Cape of Good Hope, with a
general cargo.  Our poor boat, tossing on the sea, had
been descried about daybreak, by a man who was at
work on the maintopgallant yard.  She immediately
bore down upon us, and hence our rescue at a time
so critical.  I must have been insensible for about
four hours when her crew found me; and but for
their ministrations, could not have survived another.
</p>

<p>
Fortunately for Hartly and me, the jolly and
hospitable captain had his wife on board, and she
nursed us with the tenderness of a mother.  Indeed,
honest Baylis and his whole crew vied with her in
their attention to us.
</p>

<p>
Our feet and legs were so soddened by the bitter,
briny water in which they had been so long
immersed, that for some days mortification was
dreaded; but as Mrs. Baylis had six goats on board,
she made, and skilfully applied, poultices of bread
and milk, which ameliorated the symptoms and our
sufferings.
</p>

<p>
Food and liquids were administered to us in
homoeopathic doses at first; and several days elapsed
before our interiors became accustomed to receive
their usual quantities.  At times we were both
somewhat bewildered in mind&mdash;especially when the
vessel encountered rough weather, and rolled much.
Then Hartly and I were sure to imagine ourselves
again in the longboat on the desolate sea, with the
starving and dying around us; and long the voices
of poor Hans Peterkin, of Paul Reeves, and the
notes of Cuffy's violin, lingered in my ear, especially
in dreams.
</p>

<p>
In about a fortnight&mdash;thanks chiefly to the
kindness and nursing of Mrs. Baylis&mdash;we were able to
sit on a sofa under an awning on the poop-deck; for
we were now in warmer latitudes, and a protection
from the sun of June was necessary.  We greeted
each other like two kinsmen who had escaped death;
but Hartly mourned the loss of the <i>Leda</i> and of her
crew, as they were all picked men, whom he never
paid off on entering a port, but who had sailed
with him to all parts of the world, and would as
readily have thought of attempting to fly in the air
as of leaving the poor old <i>Leda</i>.
</p>

<p>
For many days her loss, and the anecdotes connected
with it, formed a staple subject for our
conversation, until other thoughts, with returning
health, forced themselves upon us; for those who are
in the world must live for it.
</p>

<p>
The <i>Princess</i> was bound, I have said, for the Cape
of Good Hope, where she would, perhaps, take a
freight home for London; but there was an equal
probability of her being chartered for Bombay, Hong
Kong, or anywhere else, so that on reaching Cape
Town there would be an immediate necessity for
Hartly and me looking about us, and seeking means
for returning to the great metropolis.
</p>

<p>
As we approached the line, the heat increased
rapidly, awnings were spread over the decks,
wind-sails were rigged down the hatchways, and skeets
over the sides were resorted to daily.
</p>

<p>
The latter are pieces of grooved wood, for throwing
water over the planks or outer sheathing of a
ship, to prevent them from being rent by the heat of
the sun in warm climates.
</p>

<p>
For some weeks Hartly and I were totally unable
to make ourselves of any use, so great was the lassitude
which succeeded our recent sufferings, and rapid
transition from starvation and misery to comfortable
quarters, and from the Regions of Ice to those of the
burning sun; for after passing St. Jago, the most
southerly of the Cape de Verd Isles, we rapidly
approached the line; and then Captain Baylis, his wife,
Hartly, and others, prepared letters for home, to be
left at the Isle of Ascension, or given to the first
ship that passed us for England.
</p>

<p>
Day after day I reclined listlessly under the
awning, watching the shining sea, on which many
an argonauta now was floating; and, in a warm
latitude, singularly beautiful are those little
"Portuguese men-of-war," as our sailors term them, when
whole fleets of them may be seen sailing past, with
their purple sails up and rowing swiftly, with all
their tentacula or feelers out.
</p>

<p>
But, on being approached by anything, in go the
tentacula, and down sinks the miniature sail, as the
fish concentrates itself in its shell, and both vanish
together, like a fairy in the sea.

<h3>
CHAPTER XXXIV.
<br /><br />
THE SAILOR'S POST-OFFICE.
</h3>

<p>
We crossed the line on the last day of June.  I need
not rehearse the description of a hackneyed
ceremony known to all&mdash;how curtains were rigged
amidships&mdash;how Father Neptune with his hempen beard
came on board, seated on a gun-carriage, and how
roughly all who had <i>not</i> crossed the line before
were tarred, scraped, shaved, and soused by his
whimsically attired barbers, courtiers, and Tritons,
to the great delight of the older salts&mdash;a ceremony
which I only escaped in consequence of my recent
sufferings.
</p>

<p>
Two days after, we passed St. Matthew, a little
desert isle on which the Portuguese formed a
settlement so early as 1516, and which lies "amid the
melancholy main," at a vast distance from the
African coast.  It is the abode of sea-birds alone.
</p>

<p>
Then we completed our bag of letters, which were
all duly gummed up&mdash;wax will not do in the
tropics&mdash;for delivery at Ascension, which, after three
hundred miles' further run, we sighted on the evening
of the 9th July, for we had a fine wind, and the
<i>Princess</i> carried her studdingsails night and day.
</p>

<p>
I was not without hope that we might find some
homeward-bound vessel at Ascension, on board of
which we might be transferred, as I was most
anxious to return home to tranquillize the minds of
my own family, whom I knew must long since have
numbered me with the dead; but this hope was
dissipated when we came abreast of the roadstead,
which was <i>empty</i>, and let go our anchor about
midnight, in fourteen fathom water, on a red sandy
bottom.
</p>

<p>
The anchorage of this solitary isle is a sheltered
creek, overshadowed by a high pyramidal mountain,
having on its summit the remains of two great
crosses, erected of old by the pious and adventurous
followers of Juan de Nova, a Portuguese mariner
who flourished in the days of King Alfonzo Africanus.
</p>

<p>
The heat was so great now that the atmosphere
in the cabin rendered one absolutely breathless;
and with pleasure, Hartly and I, clad in light
clothes, with broad straw hats, furnished to us by
kind Captain Baylis, accompanied him and his wife
ashore next morning after anchoring, and landed at
the little town, which is fortified, and the harbour of
which frequently forms a rendezvous for our African
squadron.  The longboat with her crew afterwards
came off for fresh water and turtles.  The superintendence
of collecting these was left to the chief
mate, while with Hartly (who had been there before),
Captain Baylis and I set forth on a ramble over the
island, which is only nine miles long by six miles
broad.
</p>

<p>
An undefinable interest is excited when landing
on a lonely little island after a long sea voyage; and
for ages Ascension has been a species of halfway
house, or resting-place for ships between Europe
and the Cape.
</p>

<p>
We resolved to visit the <i>Sailor's Post-office</i>, a
cranny in the rocks, known for ages to the mariners
of all nations, who were wont to deposit their letters
there, closed up in a bottle, to be taken away by the
first ship which passed in an opposite direction&mdash;a
custom which the Dominican, Father Navarette,
mentions as being <i>old</i>, at the time of his visit in
1673.
</p>

<p>
The little isle is barren, but having been rent by
volcanic throes, it has hills of pumice-stone and
calcined rocks, with abrupt precipices overhanging
sterile ravines that are full of black ashes.  Here
and there a solitary goat might be seen cropping the
scanty herbage, or perched upon a sharp pinnacle,
snuffing the sea breeze that waved its solemn
beard.  Where a spring gurgled from the rocks into
the sea the turtle were seen in plenty, and there our
boat's crew came in search of them.  There also lay
the skeletons of great numbers, which seamen, in
mere wantonness, had turned on their backs, and
left thus to die.
</p>

<p>
From the summit of the pyramidal hill which
overlooks the anchorage we could survey the boundless
ocean, spreading away towards the distant shores
of Africa, the still more distant coast of Peru, and the
unexplored waves of the Southern Sea, all glassy,
heaving, and vibrating like a mighty mirror under
the vertical glare of the tropical sun.
</p>

<p>
Fanning ourselves with banana leaves, for at
times we gasped in the heat, we trod among ashes
ankle deep, and over rocks where the power of the
sun had turned to fine salt the spray cast upon
them by the sea.
</p>

<p>
At last we reached the Sailor's Post-office, and
examined the cleft in the rocks, where the bottles or
cases containing many a letter that carried to the
hearts and homes of generations long since gone to
dust, hope and happiness, or it might be sorrow and
woe&mdash;the tidings of loved and lost ones far away in
lands and seas that were then so little known and
so little traversed; and then combining prose with
poetry, we sat down to discuss some light sherry,
pale ale, and sandwiches, which the worthy Captain
Baylis insisted on conveying for us in a
travelling-bag slung over his shoulder.
</p>

<p>
As evening drew on, the sterile rocks and impending
bluffs, the great rugged pyramidal hill that
towered over the anchorage, the little town of
Ascension, with its battery and gaudy Union Jack,
all assumed a dusky red hue; and when the sun
sank westward, the shadow of the <i>Princess</i> at her
anchor was thrown far across the bright blue water
of the creek.  Our last boat with turtle, bananas,
fish, and fresh water, was to leave the harbour at
sunset; so we were preparing to descend, when an
object lying among some stones at the bottom of
the cleft in the rock, caught Hartly's eye.
</p>

<p>
Scrambling among ashes and black pumice-stone,
he reached, and drew it forth.
</p>

<p>
It was a stone jar, shaped like a ginger-beer bottle,
tightly corked, and covered over the mouth and neck
by thin sheet-lead, which was paid over with old
tarred spunyarn; but it was so thickly encrusted with
lichens and dust, which the sun and dew had baked
upon it, that it had quite the colour and aspect of
the stones that lay around it.
</p>

<p>
"Now, what the deuce is this?" asked Captain
Baylis.
</p>

<p>
"A bottle," said Hartly, turning it over.
</p>

<p>
"A bottle in the Post-office!"
</p>

<p>
"It must have lain here a long time, if we judge
by its outside," said I.
</p>

<p>
"Letters have never been deposited here since
1816," observed Baylis, "when the British built the
town and battery yonder."
</p>

<p>
"So if it has lain here one year, it must have lain
fifty."
</p>

<p>
"Shake it, Hartly," said I.
</p>

<p>
"It is full of something that rattles!"
</p>

<p>
"Letters, probably; but few folks can care about
them now."
</p>

<p>
"Faith! the man's head does not ache that untwisted
this spunyarn; it is at least seventy years
old!" said Captain Baylis, fraying the strands with
his fingers; "but we'll crack the bottle when we get
on board, and see what the contents are."
</p>

<p>
We joined Mrs. Baylis at the landing-place.  She
was reclining in the stern of the gig with a large
white umbrella over her head, and could scarcely
repress her curiosity to discover the contents of the
old stone jug, or bottle, till we got on board.
</p>

<p>
Then we broke it by a blow of a hammer, and
there fell out, not letters, as we expected, but a roll
of paper, consisting of leaves stitched together, and
closely covered with writing, containing a narrative,
or something of the kind, which had been deposited
in that strange mode and strange place by some
waggish or eccentric person, in the hope, perhaps,
that if ever discovered, by the mystery enveloping
their literary production, it would assuredly be given
to the public.
</p>

<p>
It was without date; but fortunately the handwriting
was plain and legible, though the ink was
dim and faded, for the stone bottle being porous, the
paper had become damp, almost wet, and had to be
carefully dried in the sunshine, which curled it up
like crisped leaves in autumn, so the preparation
of it for perusal was consigned to my care by
Captain Baylis, who had discovered that I was, as
he said, "a regular-built bookworm."
</p>

<p>
"It is a history," said he, as he lighted his long
clay pipe in the cabin, after the <i>Princess</i> got under
weigh next evening, and stood out of the anchorage
under her courses and topgallant sails, with her
royals, spanker, and gaff-topsail set.
</p>

<p>
"Or the narrative of an unfortunate voyage,"
suggested Hartly, thinking, doubtless, of his own.
</p>

<p>
"Or the revelation of some dreadful crime, or
unfortunate love-story," lisped Mrs. Baylis, all
impatience, pausing and looking up in the act of
pouring out our tea.
</p>

<p>
"It is none of these," said I; "but seems to be
the translation of a Portuguese legend, connected in
some way with the discovery of the Cape of Good
Hope."
</p>

<p>
And so, while the good captain lounged in his
shirt sleeves on the cabin sofa, and puffed away with
his long clay pipe, while his buxom wife made tea
for us, and Hartly lit his Havannah, I commenced
to read the MS. we had found so singularly; and
it ran thus&mdash;but requires a chapter or two to itself.
</p>

<p><a id="chap35"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XXXV.
<br /><br />
MS. LEGEND OF EL CABO DOS TORMENTOS.
</h3>

<p>
It is written&mdash;says the Spanish Dominican Friar
and Missionary Priest, the Padre Navarette&mdash;that
the first time reports reached Europe of a spectre
haunting the Cape of Storms, was by the narratives
of certain Portuguese adventurers, who sailed into
the Southern Sea, with the Senhor Bartholomew
Diaz, in the early part of the fifteenth century, when
Dom Joam II. occupied the throne of Portugal.
</p>

<p>
His cousin and successor, King Emmanuel, fired
by the discoveries made in the reigns of his
predecessors, who had planted their flag and cross on
the shores of Madeira, the Azores, and Isles of the
Cape de Verd, resolved to accomplish what they had
failed in, and with praiseworthy zeal despatched an
admiral to discover a passage to India by sea.
</p>

<p>
After a long absence this cavalier returned and
reported that he had found the <i>southern</i> extremity of
the mighty African continent; but, that his ships
had encountered great perils when off a flat-headed
mountain of wondrous form, which he had named
<i>El Cabo dos Tormentos</i>.
</p>

<p>
The King of Portugal suggested that "<i>El Cabo
de Buena Esperanto</i>, (<i>i.e.</i>, the Cape of Good Hope),
would be a better term;" and it was at once adopted
by his courtiers, though the mariners of the Admiral
adhered to "the Cape of Torments," as they alleged
that, not only had they nearly been swallowed by the
waves of a black and stormy sea, but that they had
seen a stupendous form, resembling a human figure,
riding upon the whirling scud above the Table Mountain,
and spreading his giant arms as if to clasp them
in his terrible embrace, and hurl them into the
yawning deep.
</p>

<p>
They insisted that this dangerous promontory was
the end of the habitable world&mdash;the abode of devils,
spectres, and torments&mdash;a place wherein nothing
human could dwell; and that the seas which washed
its shore should be shunned by all future navigators.
</p>

<p>
They ridiculed the title of <i>Buena Esperança</i>, and
urged that no mariner in his senses would visit the
place again; for the old salts of those days devoutly
believed in tales of
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "That sea-snake tremendous curled,<br />
  Whose monstrous circle girds the world,"<br />
</p>

<p class="noindent">
and that the earth was girt with fire at the Equator;
that whoever passed the tempestuous Cape Bojador,
which was first doubled by the Portuguese in 1433,
and which forms the southern limit of Morocco, was
doomed never to return, as a mysterious breeze (the
trade wind?) blew for ever against them; that ships
got into currents that ran <i>down hill</i>&mdash;currents
against which they might beat and struggle in vain,
till their shattered hulls were cast upon Bermuda&mdash;the
"vexed Bermoothes" of Shakespeare, which, as
Stowe tells us, "were supposed to be inhabited by
witches and devils"&mdash;an iron shore where perpetual
storms raged, and fated ships were dashed upon the
rocks.
</p>

<p>
Despite these terrors, animated by a spirit of
adventure, Vasco da Gama, a valiant mariner and
cavalier of Alentejo, resolved to sail in quest of this
terrible cape, accompanied by many of his friends,
among whom was a noble young hidalgo, named
Vasco da Lobiera, grandson of the gallant knight of
that name, who fought at the battle of Aljubarotta,
and received his spurs on the field from King Joam
of good memory, at whose feet, in after years, he
laid his famous romance, "Amadis de Gaul."
</p>

<p>
From his grandsire young Vasco inherited a love
of wild adventure; thus his mind was full of
tales of
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "The days when giants were rife<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With their towers and painted halls,<br />
  And heroes, each with a charmed life,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rode up to their castle walls&mdash;<br />
  When gentle and bright ones with golden hair<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were wooed by princes in green,<br />
  And knights with invisible caps to wear,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could see, and yet never be seen."<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Notwithstanding the alleged terrors of the spectre
or storm fiend which haunted the Cape, the brave
Da Gama and his friend Lobiera resolved to set forth
upon these mysterious waters, and to double the
promontory of Southern Africa.  So the former, as
Captain-General, hoisted his banner on board the
<i>San Gabriel</i>, of two hundred and twenty tons;
while Paulo da Gama, his brother, commanded the
<i>San Rafael</i>, of one hundred tons.
</p>

<p>
Vasco da Lobiera had the caravella named <i>Nossa
Senhora da Belem</i> (or Bethlehem), with Joam da
Coimbra as pilot, and Gonsalo Nunez had their great
storeship laden with provisions.
</p>

<p>
All these vessels were built of the pines which
were planted in the forest of Marinha by King Denis
the Magnificent, and were manned by one hundred
and sixty chosen mariners.
</p>

<p>
King Emmanuel made them a farewell oration,
and gave into the hands of each commander a white
silk banner of the military order of Christ, together
with his royal letters to an imaginary potentate,
who was supposed to dwell beyond the Southern
Sea, and was named Prester John of the Indies,
Lord and Emperor of Ethiopia; and so, with the
prayers of all good Portuguese for their success, the
little squadron sailed from Lisbon, on the 8th July,
1497, when it is recorded that "thousands remained
weeping on the shore, until the last traces of the
receding fleet had disappeared."
</p>

<p>
Among their own crews, as well as among those
of the other two ships, Da Gama and Da Lobiera
found men averse to touching at the Cabo dos
Tormentos; and these urged, that to double this
dreadful promontory, they should stand further out to
sea than the adventurers of Dom Joam's days, and
then visit in safety the realms of Prester John on
the other side.  Gama and his friend heeded neither
their remarks, their exhortations, or their fears, but
bore away steadily to the southward.
</p>

<p>
After a long and perilous voyage, and after
anchoring in a great bay which they named Angra
de Santa Elena, the crew of <i>Our Lady of Belem</i>
first saw the land of Table Bay on the morning of
Saturday, the 4th of November, when, in obedience
to Dom Vasco da Lobiera, the ship's company donned
their gayest apparel, discharged a volley from their
culverins, and blew all their trumpets; but, as they
stood towards the shore, they were compelled to
lessen their canvas, for the wind, which had hitherto
been moderate and favourable, now changed to the
south-east, and increased to a gale, while the sun set
in dense clouds, and turning from light green to
black, the waves began to froth and break as they
alternately rose into hills or sank into valleys.
</p>

<p>
And now as night and mist descended together
on the sea, and on the Cabo dos Tormentos,
lightnings began to play about the awful summit of
the Table Mountain, which rises for more than three
thousand two hundred feet above the shore.  The
four ships which prior to this evening had kept
close together, were compelled by the violence of
the gale to separate, lest they might be dashed
against each other; and in the murk and gloom
they continued to beat against the headwind, with
their topsail-yards lowered upon the cap, their
courses close reefed, and their spritsails stowed.
</p>

<p>
When the vessels last saw each other, the Senhor
Vasco da Lobiera was much chagrined to perceive
that his caravella had dropped far astern of her
companions.  He had ever prided himself upon the
swiftness of her sailing, and now he burned lights,
and strove to come abreast of the Captain-General,
who had beat far to windward, and who he feared
might attribute his drifting so much a-lee, and
towards danger, to want of skill or seamanship.
</p>

<p>
He set as much canvas as he dared, and <i>Nossa
Senhora da Belem</i> tore through the angry sea with
her foresail and foretopsail close reefed, and her jib
and spritsail set, while the waves lashed her worn
sides, and burst in foam over her carved and lofty
prow at every furious plunge.
</p>

<p>
The seamen told their beads, lit candles before
the shrine of Nossa Senhora in the great cabin,
shook their heads, muttered under their long black
beards, or maintained gloomy silence, fearing they
knew not what, but anticipating all the terrors that
had beset the followers of Bartholomew Diaz in the
same waters.
</p>

<p>
And now wave after wave broke in thundering
volume over her decks, till Lobiera was fain to cast
overboard the brass culverins which had been
consecrated by the Bishop of Lisbon, and his men
averred that each uttered <i>a cry</i> as it sank into the
sea.
</p>

<p>
By midnight they were, as Joam da Coimbra
stated, about six miles from the mouth of Table
Bay.
</p>

<p>
Hoarsely roared the wind through the strained
shrouds of the labouring caravella, as she rolled and
pitched wildly amid the black and fearful waste of
water, and ere long she was driving under bare poles
with only her jib and staysail to lift her head from
the sea, which rushed upon her like a succession of
watery mountains.
</p>

<p>
With all the firmness of true mariners and cavaliers,
Vasco da Lobiera and his friend Joam stood at
the tiller, crossing themselves ever and anon when
they shouted a command through the trumpet, or
invoked our Lady of Belem.  The deck had long
since been cleared of every loose spar, bucket, or
other material by the waves; and more than one
poor mariner had been swept overboard to perish
miserably in the midnight sea, for no human hand
could assist them.
</p>

<p>
Some there were who asserted that they had seen
the claws of a giant figure start from the black
waves, and drag their shipmates down below by
their beards and trunk hose.
</p>

<p>
"We make no progress," said others, rending
their hair; "a mighty magnet, buried deep in the
sea, holds us to one accursed spot!"
</p>

<p>
"Nay," said Joam da Coimbra; "'tis the teeth
of a mighty fish that grasp our keel."
</p>

<p>
"Be of good cheer, I pray you, my friends," said
Vasco, pointing to the Southern Cross, which was
then visible through a rent in the fast flying scud;
"behold the sign by which we shall conquer!  What
says the motto of our country?"
</p>

<p>
"<i>In hoc signo vinces!</i>" exclaimed Joam da
Coimbra, throwing his hands towards the south.
</p>

<p>
"Amen," responded the terrified crew, and still
their ship bore on.
</p>

<p>
"Thou art right, Joam," said Vasco da Lobiera;
and the courage of the crew revived, for their pilot
was a mariner of great experience, and, like Chaucer's
shipman&mdash;

<h3>
CHAPTER XXXVI.
<br /><br />
LEGEND CONTINUED&mdash;THE CATASTROPHE.
</h3>

<p>
The moon, which had hitherto been concealed in
dense vapour, now glanced at times through the
flying clouds.  It was one of those stormy moons
well known in that quarter of the world.  She
seemed small, but keen and bright, gilding with
whitest silver the ragged edges of the torn vapour,
which fled past with such speed as to give her
literally the aspect of sailing through the sky.
</p>

<p>
A mournful and moaning sound now came upon
the wind which traversed that dashing sea, and the
mariners of Lobiera, who had never looked on such
a scene, nor beheld such lightnings as those that
girdled like a fiery belt the flat summit of the Table
Mountain, were becoming more bewildered and faint
of heart, when a cry of dismay burst from Joam da
Coimbra, and now even the resolute Vasco stood
speechless and aghast.
</p>

<p>
Above the Table Mountain the clouds rapidly
rolled themselves into a denser and darker mass,
which assumed the outline of a human figure that
grew in volume while they gazed upon it, until it
towered into the sky, against the moonlit blue of
which it was defined with terrible distinctness.
</p>

<p>
"The spectre&mdash;il demonio del Cabo dos Tormentos!"
said each in his heart, while it continued
to tower, with mighty arms outstretched, as if to
clutch the devoted ship, or bury it in the sea that
seethed around this dreadful cape&mdash;the great
promontory of the southern world.
</p>

<p>
With one foot planted on Table Mountain, and
the other on the Devil's Hill, with a head that
darkened heaven, stood this mighty form, which
appeared to have the power of curbing and of
loosening the elements, for at every wave of its
threatening arms the sea increased in turbulence,
and the wind in fury, for the thunder appeared to
be his voice, the lightning the flashes of his eye,
the tempest the breath of his nostrils!
</p>

<p>
"Madre de Dios&mdash;our Lady of Belem!" prayed
Dom Vasco.
</p>

<p>
"Dei genetrix, intercede pro nobis!" was the
faint response of his quailing crew.
</p>

<p>
"Courage, comrades," he exclaimed; "I have
still the blessed banner which our Lord the King
gave me, and it shall yet float above the storm."
</p>

<p>
"But the ship has become unmanageable!" cried
Joam da Coirabra.
</p>

<p>
"Nay, say not so&mdash;Heaven forefend!  <i>Nossa
Senhora da Belem</i> is as gallant a craft as ever came
from the woods of Marinha, and she shall bear us
yet to seas beyond the power of this resentful
demon!"
</p>

<p>
Vasco da Lobiera would have said more, but a
burst of thunder drowned every other sound;
lightning filled the entire sky with lurid flame; the
wind bellowed, and the blinding rain descended in a
solid sheet upon the trembling sea with such power
as almost to still its waves.  He ordered the masts
to be cut away; only two of his crew heard the
order, or had the courage to obey it.  The rest
were crouching in a group, stupified by despair and
fear.
</p>

<p>
Three blows of a sharp axe were alone required,
the tempest did the rest, and the stately masts with
all their yards and gear vanished alongside.  The
rudder was torn from its iron bands, and now the
boasted <i>Lady of Belem</i> floated like a log upon the
waves, which incessantly broke over her, washing
the crew in succession away.  Now it was that the
heart of Vasco da Lobiera began to sink, and he
gave himself up for lost!
</p>

<p>
In a few minutes more he found himself
struggling in the sea, for his ship was hurled upon
the rocky coast and dashed to pieces.
</p>

<p>
Clutching a piece of wreck, he was tossed up by a
vast wave, that cast him stunned, breathless, helpless
and alone, upon the desolate shore of that terrible
promontory; so his holy banner availed him
nothing.
</p>

<p>
And there he lay as the sea receded, wave after
wave continuing to hiss and roar behind him, as if
loth to lose their prey.

<h3>
CHAPTER XXXVII
<br /><br />
LEGEND CONCLUDED&mdash;THE SEQUEL.
</h3>

<p>
When the Senhor Dom Vasco came to his senses,
says the Padre Navarette, morning had dawned.
All nature was calm, and the warm rays of the
rising sun were shedding light and gladness on the
land and sea.
</p>

<p>
Above him rose in sullen majesty the triple crest
of the Table Mountain, the Devil's Hill, and the
Hill of Lions; and undisturbed by a single ripple
before him lay that treacherous sea, which, but a
few hours before, had destroyed <i>Nossa Senhora da
Belem</i>.  With some surprise, Vasco found that his
doublet and hose were dry; and that his bruises
were not so severe as he might have expected, under
all the circumstances.
</p>

<p>
He arose, invoked Heaven on his knees, and
surveyed the watery plain with anxiety, to discover
whether any fragment of the wrecked caravella was
floating there; but not a vestige was to be seen, and
apparently none of his crew had reached the shore
save himself, all had perished.
</p>

<p>
The forlorn cavalier could not repress an exclamation
of bitterness and grief, on realizing the full
horror of this catastrophe; for he loved his crew,
and also the little caravella in which he had sailed
so gaily from the Tagus, on that auspicious 8th of
July.
</p>

<p>
Distant from his native land many, many thousand
miles, without a hope of rescue or release, he was
about to abandon himself to despair, when in the
vague hope of meeting another survivor, he traversed
the plain which lies at the base of the Table
Mountain, and which was then covered by white
lilies, gorgeous tulips, and almond trees, all growing
wild.
</p>

<p>
To add to his grief and terror, here he found the
remains of his friend, Joam da Coimbra, half devoured
by lions or wolves, who had dragged him from the
beach.  Dom Vasco shuddered, and was hastening
on, when a deep voice that seemed to fill the whole
welkin, cried,
</p>

<p>
"<i>Stay!</i>"
</p>

<p>
He turned, and beheld a copper-coloured man of
wondrous stature, and savage, yet noble aspect, who
held in his right hand a hunting spear, so long, that
it was twice the length of any Vasco had ever
seen&mdash;aye, thrice the length of the lance his grandsire
had carried at Aljubarrota&mdash;and in his left a reeking
skin, which he had just torn from a lion&mdash;perhaps
one of those that had been feasting on the hapless
pilot.  His aspect was alike sublime and terrible;
his black beard was of majestic length; his bright
eyes wore a sad and gloomy expression, and his hair
which rose in great curls, like those of the Phidian
Jove, resembled the mane of a sable lion.  But what
is stranger than all, this wild man spoke very good
Portuguese.
</p>

<p>
"In the name of Heaven," said the cavalier,
"who and what are you?"
</p>

<p>
"The spirit of the Cabo dos Tormentos&mdash;the
demon of the storm which rent your ship asunder,
and cast it on yonder shores, dashed to a thousand
pieces," replied the form in a deep, but melodious
voice.
</p>

<p>
Vasco&mdash;continues the Padre Navarette&mdash;doubted
the evidence of his senses.  This was like one of the
adventures with which the history of "Amadis de
Gaul" had filled his mind&mdash;one for which he longed;
but he felt the reality the reverse of pleasant.
</p>

<p>
"I have ruled these regions since the ark rested
on Mount Ararat, and since the land was parted
from the waters; but never until now, has the foot
of man invaded them; and had my power prevailed
in the storm of yesternight, instead of being here,
thou too shouldst have found a grave where many
other adventurers lie, in yonder rolling sea."
</p>

<p>
"Terrible spirit," said Dom Vasco, "is the
presence of a mere mortal so hateful to you?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes," replied the demon, shaking his mighty
locks with gloom and sadness; "for now my power
over these seas, and shores, and clouds, must end
where thine begins.  Else, wherefore did I bury ship
after ship in that tempestuous sea, or split them by
the flaming bolts, that all on board might perish?
Many have sought to pass my promontory, to reach
the golden realms of Prester John, but none have
escaped me save <i>thee</i>!  I have had the power of
assuming what form I please.  To-day I am a man,
to-morrow I should tower to the skies astride the
Table Mountain, or ride the wild blast that comes
from the arid desert of Zahara, to bury some barque
in the distant sea; but that my power is passing
away from me.  I tell thee, O most fortunate and
valiant cavalier, that from this day the Cabo dos
Tormentos shall be a Cape of Storms no more, but
one of Good Hope to all the mariners of the
earth&mdash;for so it was ordained by the hand which placed
Adam in Eden and gave such wondrous power
unto the Seal of Solomon."
</p>

<p>
As the spirit concluded, his voice became fainter;
his broad and dusky chest heaved as he sighed
deeply, and he gradually appeared to dissolve into a
thin white vapour, which floated upwards and
melted away on the summit of the Table Mountain.
But the power of the spirit lingers there still; for
over the same spot where he vanished from the
eyes of Dom Vasco, <i>a thin white cloud</i>, which rises
from the hill, is unto this day the sure forerunner of
a storm.*
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="footnote">
* In summer, when the S.E. wind blows, a cloud called
<i>the Tablecloth</i> appears on the mountain, and always indicates
a tempest.  This cloud is composed of immense masses of
fleecy whiteness.&mdash;<i>Arnott</i>.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Next day, the <i>San Rafael</i>, the vessel of Da
Gama, which had been greatly shattered by the
tempest, appeared off Table Bay, and on Vasco da
Lobiera making signals, a boat was sent for him
and he was brought on board, more dead than alive
after all he had undergone.
</p>

<p>
To the wondering followers of his friend, he
related his adventure.  They deplored the loss of his
caravella, and of so many good and pious Portuguese;
but they shook their long beards doubtfully when
he spoke of the spectre, though the unusual
calmness of the weather about the Cabo dos Tormentos
seemed to verify his story and the promises made
to him.
</p>

<p>
On being joined by the vessels of Paulo da Gama
and Gonzalo Nunez, they bore away to the
eastward, and named the coast La Terra de Noel (or
Natal) having anchored off it on Christmas Day.
Sixty leagues from the Cape, they found a bay, which
they named San Blaz, and in it an island, full of birds
with bat's-wings.  (Penguins.)
</p>

<p>
Thus the passage of the Cape of Storms was
fully achieved and the spell broken by these valiant
Portuguese; but they could nowhere discover the
realms of Prester John, so the royal letters of Dom
Emmanuel remained unopened.
</p>

<p>
On his return to Lisbon, Dom Vasco applied to
the King of Portugal for a gift of the Table
Mountain, and money to colonize the land about it, in
virtue of his interview with the spectre; but he was
laughed at by the courtiers, and especially by the
priests, who proved his greatest enemies.
</p>

<p>
The King, after this, styled himself Lord of the
Seas on both sides of Africa; Lord of Guinea,
Ethiopia, Persia, India, Brazil, and many other
lands; but how fared it with Dom Vasco da Lobiera?
</p>

<p>
Fury, pride, and mortification turned his brain;
but he survived till the reign of King Joam III.,
when he was last seen, an old and impoverished man,
with a white head and threadbare doublet, hovering
in the Rua d'Agua de Flore in Lisbon, at the gate of
the Estrella, or at the chapel of Nossa Senhora da
Belem, raving to the passers about the friendly
Demon of el Cabo de Buena Esperança, and the
colony of which the King had deprived him.
</p>

<p>
So&mdash;says the Padre Navarette&mdash;ends this wild
story.

<h3>
CHAPTER XXXVIII.
<br /><br />
WE LAND IN AFRICA.
</h3>

<p>
And now to resume my own more simple narrative.
</p>

<p>
The barque <i>Princess</i>, which, until we touched at
Ascension, had been favoured with singularly fine
weather, now encountered strong head-winds.  She
was driven out of her course, and had to run well
in, on the African coast.
</p>

<p>
After long beating about, on the 2nd of August
we saw the great continent on the southern shore of
the Gulf of Guinea.
</p>

<p>
The winds had become light and the weather
cloudy.  On this day I remember the crew were
variously employed, and the carpenters were busy in
making two new topgallant masts, to replace those
injured in the rough weather we had so recently
encountered.
</p>

<p>
About six P.M. the weather became squally.
Captain Baylis ordered the studding-sails to be taken
in, and the chain-cables bent to the anchors.  At
midnight we took in the royals and flying-jib.
</p>

<p>
At four o'clock on the morning of the 3rd, as we
required fresh water, we came to anchor in a little
sheltered bay of the Rio Gabon, which lies between
the Bight of Benin and Cape Lopez Gonsalvo.
</p>

<p>
The wondrous transparency of the atmosphere
here exceeded all I had seen&mdash;even in the pure region
of eternal ice; for amid the clear splendour of the
heavens, the eye could observe without a telescope
many a lesser star unseen in the north; and on this
morning when we were coming to anchor, two of the
fixed planets shone with a refulgence so brilliant as to
cast the shadow of the ships far across the estuary.
</p>

<p>
By this time, the hot vertical sun of the tropics
had peeled all the paint off the blistered sides of the
<i>Princess</i>.  Her anchors and ironwork had become
mere masses of red rust, her once white paint had
been turned to orange colour, and her tar to dirty
yellow, while the caulking and pitch had boiled out
from her planks and seams.
</p>

<p>
Captain Baylis had no intention of remaining here
longer than he could avoid, as the climate is
unhealthy.  Though the hills which overlook the river
are of considerable height, the land between it and
them is but a series of swamps, where the gigantic
water-weeds of Africa and the wild mangrove-trees
flourish in rank luxuriance, and where the hideous
crocodile squatters in the slime, or crawls along the
sand, where its eggs are hatched by the hot sun, if
they are not previously stolen by the ichneumon.
</p>

<p>
While the chief mate went off in the long-boat to
the Pongos&mdash;as the little isles at the mouth of the
estuary are named&mdash;to fill several casks with fresh
water, Captain Baylis proposed a visit to a negro
village on the coast, for the purpose of procuring
some elephants' teeth and leopard skins, and having
a <i>palaver</i> with the natives, many of whom, though
extremely savage, have picked up a little English by
the frequent visits of our ships, particularly those of
the African squadron.
</p>

<p>
With a view to barter, he placed in his gig four
old rusty muskets, some well-worn table knives, old
coats, pots and kettles, while, to be prepared for any
emergency, four rifles, carefully loaded and capped,
were concealed in the stern sheets, and Mrs. Baylis,
Hartly, and I accompanied him on this expedition,
which was the commencement of a series of
disasters, that ended in the destruction of nearly all
concerned.
</p>

<p>
For the lady's comfort, an awning was rigged over
the stern of the gig, which, being rowed by eight
oars, ran rapidly close in shore, where we saw a
number of black fellows in a state of semi-nudity,
gabbling, gesticulating violently, and watching our
arrival with considerable interest.
</p>

<p>
Some of their actions seeming to indicate hostility
as they brandished long spears and asseguys, Captain
Baylis stood up in the boat and displayed his old
pots and kettles, making signs that he wished to
trade or barter with them.  On this they uttered a
simultaneous yell, and disappeared among the mangroves,
which fringed all the bank of the river, and
formed a species of natural arcade by their branches
arching over from the solid soil, and taking root in
the slimy water.
</p>

<p>
Of this unsatisfactory result we could make
nothing; but in no way daunted, Captain Baylis
(though saying that he "wished he had left his good
wife on board") steered for a little creek, on entering
which, we lost sight alike of the Pongo islets and
the <i>Princess</i>, which lay at anchor in the estuary,
about four miles off.
</p>

<p>
Beaching partly the sharp-prowed and handsome
gig in the soft sand, Baylis, Hartly, and I sprang
ashore, and looked in every direction among the tall
weeds and mangroves for our sable traders; but all
was silent and still.  The breast of the broad river
was undisturbed by a ripple, and seemed to sleep in
the sultry sunshine; the silence of the mighty
forests that grew along its banks was unbroken by a
sound; and the vast baobab or calibash trees, with
their gigantic yellow fruit and wondrous horizontal
branches, covered by foliage, were drooping listlessly
in the hot and breathless atmosphere of the tropical
noon.
</p>

<p>
"I don't understand this, and, moreover, I don't
much like it," said Captain Baylis, in a low voice to
Hartly and me; "for when I was here before I
found the darkies ready enough to 'make friends,'
as they term it, and to exchange their elephants'
tusks, panther skins, and camwood for any rubbish
we could collect on board."
</p>

<p>
But he knew not that, at this time, one of the
crew of an American ship which sailed on the
previous day had wantonly shot the fetisher, or
priest of a village, and thus inspired the people with
hostility to all white strangers; and it is not
improbable that they conceived the Yankee and the
<i>Princess</i> to be one and the same vessel.
</p>

<p>
After looking about us for some time, and finding
that none of the natives returned, Baylis proposed
that we should pull a little higher up the stream, to
the village of the Rio Serpientes&mdash;or Snake River,
as it is called in the charts&mdash;a tributary of the
Gabon.
</p>

<p>
The giant size of the plants, shrubs, and trees,
their wonderful greenness and luxuriance, the
brilliance of the flowers, the loud hum of insect-life,
where insects are as large as birds at home, the
depth of the forest dingles, and the overpowering
heat of the atmosphere, all served to impress me
with novelty and strangeness; while mingled
emotions of wonder, pleasure, and apprehension filled
my breast.
</p>

<p>
With deep interest I trod this wondrous soil, of
which so little is known.  "For three centuries,"
says some one, "our ships have circumnavigated
Africa, and yet, with a few exceptions, our knowledge
of its districts is very incomplete; while the interior
presents to the eye a <i>blank</i> in geography&mdash;an
unsolved problem, in moral as well as physical
science."  Though nearly four thousand years ago the valley
of the Nile was the cradle of art and commerce, we
know no more about the Mountains of the Moon
than old Ptolemy himself knew.
</p>

<p>
We were about to re-embark, when the united
yells of more than a hundred negroes rent the
clear welkin, and starting from the leafy seclusion
of the mangroves into the blaze of sunlight, a horde
of black and naked savages rushed upon us with
long asseguys, bows, clubs, and knives; and in a
moment we found ourselves their prisoners.
</p>

<p>
Two seamen in the bow of the gig, while attempting
to shove her off, were struck through the body
with poisoned spears, and slain on the instant; the
rest were dragged out, the gig itself was lifted fairly
out of the water, hoisted on the brawny shoulders
of nearly twenty men, and borne with yells of
derision and exultation up the bank, where they hurled
it high and dry ashore among the mangroves; while
at the same moment, poor Baylis with horror
saw his shrieking wife dragged by others into the
jungle.
</p>

<p>
After being beaten with asseguy-shafts until we
were nearly senseless, our clothes were rent from us
roughly, and in a state nearly approaching nudity,
covered with bruises, and in some instances with
blood, we were dragged into a thicket, and
brought before the King of the village, who was
seated on a grass matting, which was spread under
the umbrageous shadow of a baobab-tree, where he
was smoking a great wooden pipe.
</p>

<p>
All this passed in less than five minutes; and I
was so stunned by the rapidity of the transaction, as
well as by several blows received on the head from
lance-shafts, that the whole affair resembled a
terrible dream!
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap39"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XXXIX.
<br /><br />
THE KING OF THE SNAKE RIVER
</h3>

<p>
In that district of Africa every village has its petty
monarch, and these are all vassals of the King of
Gabon, who, in turn, is vassal of the King of Benin;
and Zabadie, the sooty sovereign of this empire, had
just died about this time.
</p>

<p>
The town, or capital (of his Majesty of the Snake
River), if it could be so named, in which we found
ourselves, was composed of some six hundred huts
or so; and these resembled a large collection of
beehives, being constructed with meshes, twigs,
straw, and turf.
</p>

<p>
I was dragged to the door of one, while a savage,
whom I conceived to be the proprietor, and who
wore a large coin at his neck, threw in my hat, coat,
vest, and trowsers, of which he had violently
possessed himself, being a person in authority and near
relation of the King.  While he grasped me by a
thong which secured my right wrist, I could
perceive within that his dwelling consisted of one
apartment, the appurtenances of which were only
mats, calibashes, a stone mortar for pounding millet,
and a cauldron of earthenware.
</p>

<p>
Closing the door, which was composed of basket-work,
he dragged me to our forlorn group, which
stood before the King, who for some time permitted
us to be pelted with stones, decayed gourds,
and pulpy water-melons, by the women and children
of his capital; and under this treatment and her
terror, poor Captain Baylis saw his unfortunate wife
about to sink without being able to yield her the
least assistance, as the point of an asseguy menaced
his throat at the slightest movement.
</p>

<p>
As an accessory to the alarm our situation excited
within us, close by where his Majesty sat was
a negro, on whom a sentence of his had just been
executed.
</p>

<p>
This miserable wretch had been tied to a stake,
disembowelled alive, and had his body thereafter
filled with hot salt.  Despite the terrors of our own
situation, his dying agonies suggested terrible
thoughts of what our own fate might be.  At last his
contortions and quiverings ceased for ever, and then,
on the hoarse beating of an old Arab drum, the pelting
was stopped, the King of the Snakes laid aside his
pipe, and while all his sable subjects, save those who
guarded us, prostrated themselves on the turf, he
commenced to address us; and Baylis, who knew
something of his jargon, replied, and translated the
conversation to us.
</p>

<p>
The Captain earnestly deprecated our treatment,
as we had come among them with the peaceful
intention of trading.  He pled especially on behalf of
his wife, and offered a great store of bottled rum, old
firelocks, pots, kettles, brass buttons, and iron nails,
as ransom for us all.
</p>

<p>
At these offers his sable Majesty, the Solon of the
Snake River, before whom had been laid the entire
contents of the gig, with the bloody garments of the
poor fellows slain in her, only grinned from time to
time, and then uttered a diabolical laugh, which
boded us no good.
</p>

<p>
This savage chief presented a dreadful aspect.
Black as ebony, tall, strong, and muscular in form,
he had a horizontal slit in his nether lip (a custom
of his people) through which he could loll his tongue
at pleasure.  This unusual aperture was so large as
to give him the appearance of having two mouths;
thus, when he grinned, the white teeth appeared at
the upper, and the red cruel tongue through the
lower.  He wore long splints of wood through
the lobes of his ears; one eye had a fiery red circle
painted round it, the other a yellow.  He wore the
skin of an ape in front like an apron; and this, with
a pair of sandals, formed of elephant hide, completed
his attire.  His weapons were a long asseguy of
tough teak wood, having a point of iron; and a
short sword of iron, curiously fashioned, with a great
leathern tassel at the end of the sheath, hung on his
left side.
</p>

<p>
Behind him a savage held the bridle of his
dromedary, which was covered by a multiplicity of
barbaric trappings.
</p>

<p>
"It is the law of Empungua," said the King,
"that he who slays a man shall have a public trial
in face of the tribe; and if he cannot justify the
act, he and all his adherents are doomed to die."
</p>

<p>
"Then," replied Baylis, "I demand justice on
those who slew two of my men, and plundered our
boat."
</p>

<p>
"But how know we not that one or both killed
the fetisher, who was at worship in the Wood of
the Devil?" demanded the King, with a dreadful
expression in his yellow eyeballs.
</p>

<p>
"Ya&mdash;ya&mdash;ya&mdash;yah!" chorused the tribe.
</p>

<p>
"I swear to you that we know nothing of the
act you mention," replied Baylis, with great
earnestness.
</p>

<p>
"The white men are liars!"
</p>

<p>
"If we had known, or been guilty of it, would
we have ventured ashore to trade or barter with
you like brothers?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes; because the white men are all liars!"
</p>

<p>
"It was done by the ship of another nation."
</p>

<p>
"All the white men belong to one tribe, and one
big canoe is very like another.  You are liars who
come over the Sea of Darkness."*
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="footnote">
* The Atlantic.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Baylis, on finding that all his assertions of
innocence met with utter disbelief, bent all his energy
to bribe our release; but his sable Majesty only
grinned through <i>both</i> his horrid mouths, and said&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Enough! the King of the Snake River will
keep what he has got, without trusting to getting
more.  The white men are false.  Who of my
people would venture to your ship when we know
now what we never knew before?"
</p>

<p>
"And what is this?"
</p>

<p>
"Accursed dog and son of a race of dogs!"
thundered the King, spitting a quid of something
like beetel-nut full in the face of Baylis; "we have
learned that you white men take our people away in
shiploads to fatten them for food, in a land far
beyond the sea!"
</p>

<p>
On this, a yell similar to that we had first heard
made wood and welkin ring.  Violent hands were
again laid on us, and we expected instant immolation;
but their purpose at present was merely to
denude us more fully of anything we had about us.
</p>

<p>
On having his shirt torn from him, poor Hartly
endeavoured to protect or conceal a little gold
locket, which contained the hair of his dead wife
and of their little ones, and which was hung at his
neck by a black silk riband.  But he received a
blow from a carved war-club which covered his face
with blood; he reeled backward, and the prized relic
was instantly appropriated by the King, who, no
doubt, deemed it the white man's fetish, a "great
medicine," or amulet.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Baylis became insensible, and was delivered
over to a crowd of women, who shouted and laughed
like devils as they bore her into a wigwam, while
her husband, Hartly, six seamen, and I, were, by
the King's order, conducted through the town of
huts, and driven like a herd towards the summit of
a high mountain, where we fully expected to be put
to death in some barbarous fashion.
</p>

<p>
Mounted on his dromedary, the King accompanied
his savages, one of whom, brilliantly smeared
over with ochre, was an esquire of the royal body, I
presume, as he sat behind, and held outspread a
broad umbrella of grass matting.

<h3>
CHAPTER XL.
<br /><br />
THE GABON CLIFF.
</h3>

<p>
A sad series of barbarities, suffering, danger, and
death make up the remainder of my story.
</p>

<p>
We were in the hands of a tribe addicted to
fetishism of the lowest kind.  Worse than the
ferocious Bisagos, who pay divine homage to a
dunghill cock, or the people of Benin, who worship
their own shadows, they adored the devil and all
snakes, from the little adder to the great cobra-capello,
and maintained temples and priests in their
honour; remaining, in this age of steam, gas, and
electricity, as ignorant as the people mentioned by
Ælian, who worshipped flies, and offered up full-fed
oxen on their shrines!
</p>

<p>
Amid a yelling horde, who, by their menacing
tones, seemed full of animosity, and no doubt were
pouring upon us their whole vocabulary of abuse,
though we understood it not, we were led up the
steep rough slope of a mountain, which rose at a
very sharp angle to a great height.  The side on
which we ascended was covered with loose stones,
amid which the wild coffee and tobacco plants, with
innumerable thorny trees&mdash;the <i>persea</i> of
Theophrastus&mdash;grew in tangled masses, with serrated
grass, having blades as sharp as knives, with many
a nameless bramble that tore our tender skins, while
gnats came upon us in swarms, and well-nigh drove
us mad; and all this we endured, while the
well-armed crew of the <i>Princess</i>, in ignorance of our
fate, were within a few miles of us!
</p>

<p>
On reaching what we supposed to be the summit
of a mountain, we found ourselves upon a green
plateau that terminated abruptly in a precipitous
cliff nearly four hundred feet in height, and
overhanging some rocky shelves, which sloped down to
the bed of the Gabon River.
</p>

<p>
Here the King dismounted from his dromedary,
and squatted his sable person on a piece of grass
matting under the royal umbrella, while several of
his chief men seated themselves at a respectful
distance, after knocking their woolly heads upon the
earth, in token of their slavish submission.
</p>

<p>
From the brow of this cliff we could see our ship
at anchor in the estuary, but alas! far beyond the
reach of signals.  We could also see the little green
Pongos, which stud the bay formed by the great
sweep of the Gabon.
</p>

<p>
Afar off on the other hand towards the east, we
could discern where, between groves of strange
trees&mdash;the plantain, banana, and the baobab&mdash;with many
a giant plant and mighty flower upon its shores,
the great river of Guinea, the Rio Gabon, rolled
from its distant source, in the unexplored land of
Ungobai&mdash;a stream so broad and deep that a sloop
of war has ascended it for more than seventy miles.
</p>

<p>
Transparent though the air was around us, a hot
sunny haze shrouded those green forests through
which the Gabon came rolling like a mighty flood
of gold towards the west&mdash;rolling through a vast
plain, covered by a leafy wilderness, where the lordly
lion with his shaggy mane, the cruel panther with
his stealthy step, and the ponderous elephant, roved
in herds; and amid the luxuriant flowers and lovely
fertility of which, the scaly cobra-capello, and a
hundred kinds of dreadful reptiles, with tongues
that teemed with poison, lurked; where every fruit
and herb were gigantic in proportion to the mighty
continent which produced them; where the crocodile
squattered in the green miasmatic slime, and the
hippopotami, huge, misshapen, and pre-Adamite in
form, swam like the great tusky walrus of the icy
regions I had left so recently.
</p>

<p>
All these natural wonders were contained in the
vast plain at our feet&mdash;a plain that seemed to
vibrate under the cloudless glare of the burning
sun; for the heat at noon must have been somewhere
about 107° in the shade, and our tender skins were
blistering under it.
</p>

<p>
But the thoughts this scene inspired for a moment
were soon diverted from it, by the terrors about
to be enacted there.
</p>

<p>
A hideous old negro, whose barbaric ornaments
announced his rank and character as a <i>fetisher</i>,
proceeded to examine, with gipsy-like care, the various
lines on the palms of our hands.
</p>

<p>
What he affected to gather therefrom we could
not divine, but the lines proved fatal to three of our
companions, whom, with yells of satisfaction, he
thrust aside from the rest, and the work of torture
and death at once began by order of the King.
</p>

<p>
Three strong and handsome young seamen had
their hands tied behind them by a thick thong.
</p>

<p>
To this a rope was attached; after this they were
thrust over the cliff, and a piercing cry, which
curdled the blood in our hearts, burst from each,
when, by the violence of the jerk and their own
weight, their arms were torn round and upward, and
dislocated in the shoulder socket.
</p>

<p>
In this horrible situation they swung at the
extremity of the suspending lines, which were made
fast to the roots of a palm-tree; and there with a
pendulous motion, they swayed to and fro in
mid-air, over the sharp edge of that impending cliff,
with the rocky bank of the Gabon four hundred
feet below.
</p>

<p>
Need I say their shrieks and cries for pity were
piercing and unheeded?
</p>

<p>
Unable to yield them the slightest assistance, we
gazed in speechless horror; while, as their strength
waned, their sad moans arose from time to time to
the plateau on which we stood.
</p>

<p>
The hungry cormorants, in anticipation of their
coming repast, came out of their holes in the cliff,
and with flapping wings, wheeled and swooped up
and down about them.
</p>

<p>
To protract the mental and bodily agony endured
by these poor fellows, they were permitted to hang
thus for nearly half an hour, when the King gave a
signal, and a score of tum-tums, or drums, were
beaten.  On this, the cords were parted by three
blows of a sharp hatchet, then the bodies of our
companions fell whizzing through the air, and vanished
from sight far down below, where no doubt the river
crocodiles, the greedy cormorants, and the wild ducks
would soon rend their poor corses asunder.
</p>

<p>
So perished these unfortunates!
</p>

<p>
We looked into each other's haggard eyes with
blank dismay; and it may readily be supposed that
such an episode made us still more spiritless and
timid.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, my wife! my poor wife!" exclaimed the
unfortunate Baylis from time to time.  "Death is but
the birthday of <i>another</i> life, the parsons tell us; but
I think with horror of her fate among such cowardly
dogs as these.  God help her!  God help her!"
</p>

<p>
A series of prolonged and exulting yells now
announced that our captors conceived they had appeased
the spirit of the fetisher whom the Yankees had
slain.
</p>

<p>
"Let them die! let them die!" (Baylis told me
were their shouts;) "they are but white dogs who
worship neither the sun nor moon, nor the big snake
that lives in the wood."
</p>

<p>
There were now but six of us remaining, and our
fate was soon decided.  The King selected Hartly
and Baylis as slaves for himself, assigning the four
others to different chief men of his town or territory.
</p>

<p>
"My poor friend," said Hartly, "this is from bad
to worse!  Why did we not perish with the <i>Leda</i>?
We shall never weather these fellows, I fear!"
</p>

<p>
I fell to the lot of the savage with the coin at his
neck, a personage whom they named Amoo&mdash;the
same supple fellow who had first pounced upon me
when we landed in that fiendish country.
</p>

<p>
As we were separated, Hartly and I had only time
to exchange a farewell glance.  My hands were still
secured by the thong, which was tied so tightly that
the flesh of my wrists was becoming blue, livid, and
swollen almost to bursting, so my aching arms were
powerless.  By blows with the shaft of his asseguy,
Amoo drove me down the hill, and conducted me to
his wigwam, when the tribe separated, and save on
one occasion I never again saw any of my poor
companions in misfortune; though I afterwards learned
the miserable fate of Captain Baylis and his wife.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap41"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XLI.
<br /><br />
HOW THE CAPTAIN PERISHED.
</h3>

<p>
I have mentioned that the gentle Mrs. Baylis&mdash;she
who had nursed us so kindly in our helplessness&mdash;had
been carried off by the women of this tribe
of devils, who confined her in a wigwam.
</p>

<p>
On perceiving the whiteness of her skin, and the
great length and softness of her hair, which was of a
fair auburn colour, forming thus a strange contrast
to their sooty exteriors, and the short, poodledog-like
tufts of wool with which their own round skulls
were covered, they diligently proceeded to make her
as like themselves as possible.
</p>

<p>
A species of gum and certain herbs were boiled in
an earthen pipkin, and with this decoction they
rubbed her whole face and body, until they became
black as ebony.
</p>

<p>
They next rooted out the whole of her soft and
beautiful hair, making her perfectly bald.  Her
head was then smeared thickly with gum, and
coated over with green and crimson parrot's feathers.
They then streaked her breast and shoulders with
red and yellow paint.  This process occupied two
entire days, during which she remained a passive
victim in their hands, and at the close&mdash;when these
ladies of the Rio Serpientes thought they had made
the unhappy woman as fiendish in aspect and as like
themselves as possible&mdash;they placed a kind of hoe
in her hands and dragged her into a plantation of
millet to work with them; as the naked warriors
and lazy husbands of Gabon, like those of other
savage districts, disdainfully leave all manual labour
to their slavish helpmates.
</p>

<p>
Despair and exhaustion rendered Mrs. Baylis
unable to work; so the negresses beat, scratched, and
bit her, till she sank under their hands at the root
of a date-tree, where she lay inert and reckless alike
of life and death; but the horrid hiss of a serpent
close by, aroused her.
</p>

<p>
So great is the instinctive love of life, that on
beholding this hideous reptile, which was of the
venomous kind and some six or eight feet long,
rearing its head to attack her, she uttered a shrill
and piercing cry for aid.
</p>

<p>
Two white prisoners who had been hewing wood
in an adjacent thicket came forth on hearing this;
but the negresses, who laughed and danced on seeing
the poor woman assailed by one of their holy snakes,
met the two men with their hoes in a hostile
attitude, and barred their advance to a rescue:
while the white men, conceiving the shrieking victim
to be a mere savage&mdash;so darkly was the skin of
Mrs. Baylis dyed by the decoctions of her
tormentors&mdash;were not over anxious to interfere.
</p>

<p>
In one of these white prisoners, worn to a skeleton,
haggard in eye, and covered with sores and bloody
bruises, she had nearly as much difficulty in
recognising her husband, the once plump and jolly captain
of the <i>Princess</i>, as he had, in tracing in the face of
that dusky and copper-coloured squaw, with her
gummed wig of red and green parrot's feathers, his
pretty English wife, with her once snowy skin and
silky auburn hair; but she cried aloud,
</p>

<p>
"Save me, Baylis&mdash;Oh, save me!  I am your poor
wife, your own Annie!"
</p>

<p>
The unfortunate Baylis trembled with mingled
rage and horror, and snatching a hoe from a negress
rushed upon the poisonous serpent, which had
already bitten its victim thrice, and beat it furiously
upon its flat head and scaly body; but while doing
so, the frantic cries of the negresses, who deemed this
an act of sacrilege, brought to the spot Amoo, with
a crowd of savages, one of whom pierced Baylis
through the heart with his asseguy, and mercifully
slew him on the instant.
</p>

<p>
The negresses then rushed upon his wife, and by
repeated blows of their implements upon her head,
face, and bosom, soon ended her miseries.
</p>

<p>
On beholding this scene of double barbarity, the
seaman who had been at work with Baylis, and who,
like him, was also a mass of sores and bruises by
the ill-usage he had undergone, became filled by a
species of frenzy.  Wresting an asseguy from Amoo,
he ran three of his followers through the body in
quick succession, and killed, or mortally wounded
them, as all these weapons are poisoned; but he
was soon overpowered by numbers, beaten down,
secured, and condemned to death by tortures, almost
too horrible for narration.
</p>

<p>
His eyes, mouth, and nostrils were forced open
and filled with hot pepper.  He was then enclosed
in a strong basket of cylindrical form, full of long
sharp thorns, and this was rolled for hours about
the town of wigwams, until he became a shapeless
mass of flesh and blood, which dropped through the
wattling of the cage; and during this dreadful
torture, under which he must soon have perished, if
he uttered cries they were unheard, as they were
unheeded, for the whooping, yelling, and beating of
tum-tums, might have made one suppose that
Pandemonium had vomited all its denizens on the
bank of the Gabon River.
</p>

<p>
While this was going on, I was at work among
the plants which grew in a patch of ground adjoining
the wigwam of Amoo; but I could in no way
discover <i>who</i> this last victim was.  However, as
Baylis and Hartly had been condemned to slavery
together, I was full of deep sorrow lest the sufferer
might be my friend.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap42"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XLII.
<br /><br />
AMOO.
</h3>

<p>
Amoo, the savage who wore the amulet or coin at
his neck, proved to be the King's brother; and when
first dragged to his miserable dwelling he informed
me, by signs&mdash;pointing to the earth which I was to
till, and to the trees which I was to hew&mdash;that I was
to be his obedient servant or slave, and by placing
the poisoned point of his asseguy in dangerous
proximity to my throat, he menacingly indicated
that death would be the result of the least attempt
at resistance or escape.
</p>

<p>
I understood his grim pantomime in all its terrible
minutiæ; but in no way daunted thereby, resolved,
whatever froward fate might have in store for me,
to leave no means untried to fly his thraldom
and reach the coast, in the hope of escaping to any
vessel that might come in sight, or anchor off the
Pongos on the same unfortunate errand as the
<i>Princess</i>.
</p>

<p>
I could no longer hope that she was still there,
as the chief mate, after the lapse of a week, would
suppose we were all murdered, and so continue his
voyage to the Cape of Good Hope.
</p>

<p>
Amoo, though savage and exacting in the tasks
he set me, was nothing in severity when compared
to his wife, for this Brave of the Rio Serpientes had
"a helpmate meet for him," who hoed his rice and
maize, shared his matted hut and couch of skins,
and who scraped in thankful silence what he was
pleased to leave her after meals at the bottom of his
calibash; who shared with the house-dog his half-picked
bones, and nursed a frightful little imp about
a month old.  They had three others, and Amoo
doubtless fondly hoped (to quote Ossian) "they
would carry his name and fame to future times."
</p>

<p>
By an anomaly in savage life, Amoo was very
much attached to his four children, while their
mother was tolerably indifferent about them, and
often forced me to carry her black bantling, which I
did, with an exhibition of all the solicitude I could
assume, and with as little disgust as possible,
conceiving that if her good will and confidence could
be won, they might improve my chances of escape;
but I strove in vain, and might as well have caudled
the cub of a she-bear.
</p>

<p>
My mistress was a negress of Guinea, and of
unusually horrible aspect.  Her lower lip was slit, and
had a long wooden peg inserted in it so curiously,
that the end thereof dangled upon her breast.  Her
great ears, set high upon her woolly head, had
ponderous rings of metal, which dragged them
downward to her shoulders.  Her teeth were dyed blood
red by some native herb, known to the fetishers
alone, and her whole body, where revealed by her
only garment&mdash;an apron of grass matting&mdash;was
covered with a species of tattooing, and always
smeared with a thick unctuous grease, in which the
embedded gnats and flies could revel undisturbed.
</p>

<p>
To eat repasts which were cooked by her odious
hands excited a loathing which hunger alone could
conquer; but anxiety for the future, and the intense
heat of the atmosphere, made me generally averse
to animal food; hence I found the yams, which
there grow like turnips (and shoot out long leaves
like French beans), my most pleasant food, as I
could cook them for myself, either by boiling them
in a pipkin, or roasting them among cinders.  The
inside is white as flour, and sweet and dry.
</p>

<p>
For many days I lived on these, with such fruit
as I could find when at work near our wigwam, and
Amoo gave me at times a little olive oil and palm wine,
but in secret, for this warrior, though fearless in other
respects, was civilized enough to be afraid of his wife.
</p>

<p>
My days were spent in hoeing yams, cutting fuel,
carrying water in calibashes, selecting long and
straight reeds for baskets, or boughs and bark to
keep the wigwam water-tight.  My mistress would
have had me dive into the bay in search of sea-eggs,
but to this I would by no means consent, and my
refusal caused an open and standing feud between us.
</p>

<p>
At night, in a corner of their wretched dwelling,
I coiled myself up on a panther skin, and for hours
would lie awake in the dark, revolving plans of
escape.  To push a passage through the wattles,
and make off under cloud of night, would have been
an easy task, could I have silenced or circumvented
the herd of ferocious dogs which guarded the town,
or rather village, after sunset, and the yells of
which, on the slightest movement, raised an alarm
that would soon cause their being unleashed and let
slip upon my track.
</p>

<p>
The negroes among whom I was cast worshipped
the sun, the moon, and the devil; and in many
instances, with singular barbarity, offered up their
youngest children to the latter, that rain might fall
in due season to make the yams big and the
bananas grow.
</p>

<p>
Amoo strove in vain to lessen the severity of his
wife, who frequently beat me with a hard club, till
I grew weary of existence, and my heart swelled
with savage thoughts of revenge.
</p>

<p>
Among the glass beads, feathers, rusty nails, and
other trash which Amoo wore as a necklace, was his
great amulet, a curious coin, which he one day
permitted me to examine, but which he would have
yielded up less readily than his life.
</p>

<p>
It proved to be a piece of the reign of Servius
Tullius, sixth King of the Romans, and consequently
must have been more than twenty-three centuries
old.  How came it there, and what was its history?
So this prize, which half the savans of Europe
would have rejoiced to possess, hung, and, for aught
that I know, still hangs at the neck of an African
savage, who found it on the sea-shore.
</p>

<p>
It was several ounces in weight, and bore on one
side the head of Minerva, on the other an ox, as
plain as if struck yesterday; and accoutred with
this "great medicine," Amoo rushed fearlessly to
encounter alike human enemies and the wild beasts
of the forests which bordered the Gabon and the
River of Snakes.
</p>

<p>
In the course of three weeks I picked up several
words of the native language, which is full of rather
musical sounds, as most of the words end in a
vowel.  The desire for escape added to the care
with which I studied it.
</p>

<p>
One day when Amoo, with other savages, was
hunting in the forest, and his better half was
paddling about in her canoe on the river fishing, she
suddenly uttered a shrill yell, which arrested me at
my work among the yams, where I was hoeing
under a broiling sun.
</p>

<p>
She was only about forty yards from me, and was
pointing frantically to a huge baboon, which had
squatted itself close by where her youngest child
was asleep, under two large plantain leaves, the
stems of which had been stuck in the turf as a
species of sun-shade.
</p>

<p>
The baboon was of the ursine species, larger
than a Newfoundland dog, and though common
enough in South Africa, I now beheld it for the
first time.  It was a hideous brute, covered with
shaggy brown hair, except on the hind feet and
hands, for its forepaws are literally <i>hands</i>, and bare
as a man's, being constantly employed in climbing
rocks and trees, pulling fruit, or grubbing up roots
and esculents for food.  Its head resembled that of
a dog, but its hind feet were rather human in form.
</p>

<p>
These baboons are so strong and bold, that they
will attack a leopard or hyæna, and by their teeth,
which are an inch-and-a-half long, and their sharp
fore-claws, can rend the throat and jugular vein
with ferocious dexterity.
</p>

<p>
The woman uttered yell after yell, and pointing
to her nursling with one hand, paddled vigorously
towards the shore with the other, while I gazed at
her with irresolution; thus, before either of us
could come to the rescue, the grisly she-baboon had
snatched it up and bounded into the forest!
</p>

<p>
Though I had no great love for the tribe of the
Rio Serpientes, the natural impulses of humanity,
together with a dread of the vengeance that might
fall upon me for neglect, caused me instantly to
rush away in pursuit.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap43"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XLIII.
<br /><br />
THE RESCUE OF HIS CHILD.
</h3>

<p>
Some time before this, I had fortunately made for
myself a pair of long sandals, formed of panther's
skin, which I wore as Bryan O'Lynn did his
breeches&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "With the skinny side out and the hairy side in."<br />
</p>

<p class="noindent">
Indeed these, and a kind of shirt of grass-matting,
were all the garments I possessed; for the savages,
on our capture, tore all our clothes into strips, that
each might have a portion; thus, every coin and
button found upon us were appropriated; even our
watches were broken up, and the wheels and springs
of them were worn in their noses and ears as
ornaments.
</p>

<p>
These sandals enabled me to run with ease and
safety through patches of prickly yams, among serrated
blades of grass, wild vines, dense creepers, and
all kinds of thorny bushes.
</p>

<p>
Two warriors, on hearing the alarm, joined me in
the pursuit.  One soon passed me, but went upon a
false trail; the other stumbled and hurt himself
severely; so relinquishing my wooden hoe for his
asseguy, I continued the pursuit alone.
</p>

<p>
Encumbered by her prey, the baboon could only
run upon her hind legs, thus I easily kept her in
sight after seeing her again.  She was making
straight towards those steep and lofty rocks which
overhang the Gabon river&mdash;the same fatal rocks
where three of our boat's crew had perished so
miserably.
</p>

<p>
But her progress was soon impeded by a wall of
gigantic reeds about ten feet high, through which a
passage seemed impossible, as they grew close and
dense amid a deep miasmatic quagmire, which
covered all the plain at the base of the rocks, and
amid which myriads of water-snakes lurked, and
poisonous reptiles squattered.  Here, too, there was
no air&mdash;not a breath could be inhaled with freedom,
for the density of the reeds obstructed every passing
current; and, gasping and bathed in perspiration,
as I drew near the savage animal she turned, and
was about to make a hostile, and perhaps most fatal
spring, in which case all had ended with me then;
when suddenly perceiving a narrow opening in the
reedy wall, she changed her intention, and entering,
again vanished with the child.
</p>

<p>
Further pursuit seemed impossible!
</p>

<p>
I sank under a tree, and for some time fanned
myself with a large leaf.  While thus employed, I
heard a strange railing cry at a distance, and on
looking round perceived the baboon, about a hundred
yards off, clambering up the face of the rocks, where
it entered a hole, and disappeared.
</p>

<p>
Though I could scarcely hope that the child of
Amoo would be alive or undevoured, I marked well
the locality of the crevice its captor had entered,
and making a detour, reached the end of the reedy
marsh, and then proceeded boldly to ascend the
rocks.
</p>

<p>
In some parts the climbing convolvoli and papyrus
grew in such masses, and were so interlaced, as to
form a rampart, against which I toiled in despair,
and had my skin torn in innumerable places, ere I
could burst through them.  One feels so helpless
without clothing.
</p>

<p>
At last I reached the vicinity of the hole,
and after pausing for a time to recover breath,
advanced with the asseguy charged breast high,
lest the fierce brute might spring forth upon
me; but on peering into the den, I saw its eyes
glancing, and its grim satyr-like visage grinning at
me, while uttering a hoarse cry.
</p>

<p>
The infant was alive, and its captor was kindly
fondling it; having been probably deprived of her
own offspring by some hunter's shaft, the act of
abduction had been prompted by a strange and
erratic maternal emotion in herself.
</p>

<p>
Amoo explained this to me afterwards as being
no uncommon occurrence.  I had no thought of it
then, but rushed upon her with the long and sharp
asseguy, and thrust it deeply into her breast.
Coiled up in her little den, and thus rendered
incapable of active resistance, she could only howl,
bite, and writhe upon the tough teakwood shaft;
while her life-blood smeared all the little black
infant, and ebbed away among the well-picked bones
of the small monkeys and wild ducks, which strewed
the hole that formed her lair.
</p>

<p>
The poor baboon expired just as I drew forth the
asseguy for a finishing thrust; and at that moment
Amoo, with a crowd of other savages, came rushing
up the rocks, and joined me, with excitement
expressed in all their wide mouths and glittering
eyeballs.
</p>

<p>
Breathless and drenched in perspiration, overcome
by exertion, and somewhat sickened by the cries and
death agonies of the half human-like creature I had
slain, I sank upon a bank of turf, incapable of
further exertion.
</p>

<p>
Amoo, after holding up his offspring by each leg
alternately, and viewing it over as one might do a
dead duck or rabbit, to ascertain if any of its bones
were broken, found that it had suffered only a few
scratches, on which he uttered sundry shrill howls
expressive of paternal satisfaction, and patted me
kindly on the head and breast, in token that
henceforth we were friends, and in amity.
</p>

<p>
"You are brave&mdash;you are brave!  Yah&mdash;yah!"
said he repeatedly.  "You are the brother of
Amoo."
</p>

<p>
Thus did I achieve the very end I had in view&mdash;to
win the confidence of my savage task-masters!
</p>

<p>
We returned to the wigwams in triumph, bringing
with us the skin of the ursine baboon on the point
of an asseguy; and the circumstance of a creature
so agile and ferocious having been slain by me, the
poor despised white slave, was evidently the cause of
much marvel to that dingy community.
</p>

<p>
From this day there was a sensible alteration in
the bearing of my mistress towards me.  I cannot
say that I gained more of her confidence, or had
fewer tasks set me, but when beating me with her
club, she entirely ceased to strike me on <i>the head</i> or
face, as she had been wont to do.  But the reason
of this unusual forbearance was explained to me by
Amoo, and proved a very cogent reason for hastening
my departure from the unpleasant vicinity of the
Snake River.

<h3>
CHAPTER XLIV.
<br /><br />
THE GRATITUDE OF HIS WIFE.
</h3>

<p>
In two instances she patted my head and smiled on
me, till the corners of her mouth went up to her
ears.
</p>

<p>
On the last occasion she gave me a large iron
knife to sharpen, indicating by various signs that a
very fine edge must be put upon it.
</p>

<p>
"She is grateful to you for saving her child," said
Amoo, who observed her.
</p>

<p>
"I am glad of it," said I, with a sigh of mingled
bitterness and impatience.
</p>

<p>
"She means to show you and the tribe that she
is so."
</p>

<p>
"The tribe too, how?"
</p>

<p>
"Yah, yah," said Amoo, as he placed one hand on
my head, and drew the right forefinger of the other
across his throat, in a way that was unpleasantly
suggestive.  Then he laughed and pointed to a
gaily painted canoe that lay among some reeds by
the river-side.
</p>

<p>
"She will assist me to escape in it to a big ship
at the Pongos?" said I with a glow of hope.
</p>

<p>
Amoo frowned, then he grinned and shook his
head.
</p>

<p>
"What then?" I asked anxiously.
</p>

<p>
After a good deal of pantomime, with which he
endeavoured to aid his explanations, at last the
horrid truth broke upon me!
</p>

<p>
She wished my caput as a figure-head to her
canoe, for which purpose, after being duly prepared
by gums, balms, and herbs, she could make it
suitable.  Amoo flatteringly added that such had been
her desire from the first, as "I was the youngest and
best-looking of the prisoners."
</p>

<p>
Here was a pleasant prospect!
</p>

<p>
"And it was for this purpose she gave me the
long knife to sharpen so carefully?"
</p>

<p>
"Yah, yah," replied Amoo, while a glow of rage
filled my breast; "and even now she is gathering
herbs on the borders of the wood to boil in the stone
jar with it."
</p>

<p>
"It&mdash;what?"
</p>

<p>
"Your head."
</p>

<p>
"I must watch."
</p>

<p>
"It is of no use to watch," replied Amoo; "sometime,
when you are not thinking of it, she will give
you some red berries, that will cause you to sleep
<i>very sound</i>; and then with her knife or a sharp
shell&mdash;yah, yah!" he concluded by a guttural laugh, and
again pressed his finger round his neck.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Heavens!" I exclaimed, "aid me to escape
from this atrocious squaw!"
</p>

<p>
I asked Amoo if he, in gratitude to me for saving
his child, would aid me to escape; but he shook
his head, adding:
</p>

<p>
"I am the brother of a great king, and must keep
my slave."
</p>

<p>
"Why?"
</p>

<p>
"To punish the white men, who fatten up our
brothers beyond the Sea of Darkness, and eat
them."
</p>

<p>
After reiterated applications to his gratitude and
pity for freedom or assistance, finding that he was
gradually losing his temper and becoming suspicious;
that his snake-like eyes were beginning to
gleam and his thick red nostrils to quiver, I
abandoned the subject, and resuming my hoe, went to my
daily task in the patch of garden where our yams
and other esculents grew, and affected to work as
usual, conscious that, for a time, my savage owner
was eyeing me with vague doubts, and while playing
ominously with his long reed-like asseguy, was
probably repenting that by his admissions he had put
me on my guard against the artistic views of his
better half.
</p>

<p>
After a time he disappeared, yet I dreaded that it
was only to conceal himself under some of the bushes,
or the leaves of the creeping gourds, to watch me, so
I affected to hoe industriously&mdash;yes, and to whistle
too, though my heart was sick and full of dreadful
apprehensions.  One thing I had resolved, come
what might, never again to commit my head to
sleep, or to pass a night within the same wigwam
with that horrible woman.
</p>

<p>
While revolving in my mind, and almost blind
with desperation, what measures I should take to
save myself, to escape from my present danger and
misery, I saw her pass from the wood towards the
town of wigwams.  In one hand she held the knife
I had sharpened so nicely for her, in the other a
basket filled with herbs&mdash;herbs, I doubted not, for
my especial behoof; and she "grinned horribly a
ghastly smile," as she walked on with that shuffling
gait peculiar to these negresses.
</p>

<p>
My heart swelled with so much rage and hatred
at this hideous creature, that I had some difficulty
in repressing a vehement desire to beat her down
with my hoe; but such a proceeding would only
have ensured and accelerated my own destruction;
as I knew not what number of watchful savages
might at that moment be eyeing me from amid the
jungle of leaves, flowers, and fruit which bordered
the patch wherein I worked, under a sun so vertical
that I had scarcely a shadow.
</p>

<p>
Lest such a surveillance might be maintained, I
resolved as soon as she disappeared to adopt
something of their own subtlety.
</p>

<p>
I seated myself under a tree among some weeds,
as if tired, and then, after a time, affected to sleep;
though keeping watch with open ears and half-closed
eyes, lest any one might approach; but all remained
still around me, save the monotonous hum of the
millions of insects that revolved in the shade of the
adjacent wood.
</p>

<p>
On being assured of this, I crept on my hands
and knees into the jungle, dragging my hoe after
me, and going feet foremost on my face for nearly a
hundred yards or so, that I might with my fingers
obliterate all traces of a <i>trail</i>; and in this, I was very
successful by raising the crushed grass and shaking
the bruised twigs.
</p>

<p>
At last I reached a runnel, the waters of which I
knew would destroy all scent of my footsteps, and
baffle the keen nostrils of those ferocious dogs,
which would certainly be let slip in search of me
the moment I was missed.
</p>

<p>
Assured that this runnel of water would be a
tributary of the Rio Serpientes, I proceeded up its
course for several miles, and in my anxiety to escape
the human race forgetting all about the ferocious
denizens of the African forest&mdash;the snakes and other
dreadful reptiles with which the woods, the water,
and the bordering deserts teemed.
</p>

<p>
I must have proceeded about ten miles without
meeting either man or beast to molest or obstruct
me, when evening was beginning to close, and I
found myself nearly exhausted, but within a
pleasant thicket of orange, citron, and chestnut trees,
which bordered a pretty lake, and flourished amid
the thousand flowering shrubs of this luxuriant
wilderness.
</p>

<p>
The necessity for rest forced itself upon me; but
I dared not sleep on the earth lest snakes might
assail me, and even in a tree I was not safe from the
panthers, yet I chose my couch in the latter.
Furnished with a large stone, as a missile for defence in
any emergency, grasping the hoe by my teeth, I
clambered into a chestnut-tree, scaring therefrom a
whole covey of kingfishers, copper-coloured cuckoos,
and green and flame-coloured parrots.
</p>

<p>
Then selecting a place where the leafy branches
were forked out from the stem, and grew in such a
form that I could rest upon them with ease, and
without fear of falling, I deposited the stone in a
hollow of the tree, and after an hour of anxious and
exciting watchfulness, gradually felt sleep stealing
over me&mdash;a sleep to which the "drowsy hum" of the
insects, the balmy air of the evening, the lassitude
produced by my recent travel after a day's toil under
a burning sun, all conduced; and so, heedless of
everything, at last I slept profoundly on my awkward
perch.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap45"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XLV.
<br /><br />
FLIGHT.
</h3>

<p>
In this precarious situation I must have been asleep
for some hours, when awakened by a dreadful sound,
and with a start so nervous that I nearly fell from
my roost upon the long, reedy grass below.
</p>

<p>
This sound was the roaring of a lion!
</p>

<p>
I had heard it often in menageries at home; but
there the sound was feeble as the bay of a house-dog
when compared to the dread roar, which rolled along
the ground and rent the still air of the morning in
that lone African forest.  A terror possessed me;
yet, grasping my hoe, while quivering in every fibre,
I gazed with keen anxiety between the leaves of the
chestnut-tree for the approaching enemy.
</p>

<p>
Ignorant alike of his powers of leaping and scenting,
I knew not whether the lion might, on discovering
me, at once spring up like a tree-leopard, which
can pursue its prey, like a cat, from branch to branch.
Oh, how I longed for a good rifle&mdash;a sharp sword&mdash;a
dagger&mdash;for any other weapon than the miserable
wooden club (for the hoe was no better) with which
I was armed at that moment.
</p>

<p>
The lilac light of dawning morn poured through
the thick green vista of the wild forest, and the little
lake which lay near my chestnut-tree shone white as
a sheet of milk, bordered by countless gaudy tulips
and opening flowers.
</p>

<p>
The sun was yet below the horizon, but every
dew-drenched herb, and leaf, and tree, were distinctly
visible in the clear pale light that overspread the
sky.
</p>

<p>
Every pulse quickened, and all my energies became
wound up to the utmost pitch by excitement, when
I saw the mighty lord of the wilderness&mdash;a vast
dun-coloured lion, with his large round head and
shaggy mane, powerful legs, his close round body
and tufted tail, that shook wrathfully aloft as he
trotted past swiftly, bearing a dead sheep in his
mouth.
</p>

<p>
Passing almost under the tree, and round the
margin of the lake, he disappeared in the forest; but
a sense of his terrible presence seemed to linger
about me still.  My doubts and irresolution were
increased; the dangers of the wilderness in which I
wandered, alone and unarmed, became more vividly
impressed upon me, and for a time I almost regretted
that I had left the coast, and the protection of my
savage task-masters.  But then the wife of Amoo,
and her hideous desire for possessing my head!
</p>

<p>
"Hope is the bounty of God!" thought I, and
as the forest remained still and quiet&mdash;at least, as
no sound reached my ear, save the increasing hum of
the myriads of insects warming into life and sport
in the light and heat of the rising sun&mdash;I resolved to
descend from my perch, and follow the track of any
stream which might lead to the coast, for by the
sea&mdash;the open, free, wide sea&mdash;lay my only hope of
escape from this dangerous and detested shore.
</p>

<p>
Remembering the geographical form of Africa, as
represented on the map, I knew that if I could, by
any means, proceed westward for about two hundred
and fifty miles or so round the Bight of Benin, I
should be so near our settlement at Cape Coast
Castle as to be in safety.  But how, in such a country,
was this to be accomplished?
</p>

<p>
I had already begun my descent from the tree,
when the noise of something coming rapidly through
the forest made me scramble into my perch again.
And lo! a savage, armed as usual with a long asseguy,
but mounted on a swift dromedary, came from amid
the trees, and paused by the lonely lake to give his
great misshapen nag a drink; and while he did so,
in his brawny form and tasselled apeskin apron and
sandals, his eyes with their circles of red and yellow
paint, the slit under his mouth, his hideous aspect
and barbaric trappings, I recognised the brother of
Amoo&mdash;the King of the Rio Serpientes!
</p>

<p>
Were both upon my track, or had chance alone
brought him here?  I knew that if retaken, I had
met with more mercy from the lion than from either;
and the image of the wife of Amoo, with her sharp
knife and basket of herbs and gums, seemed to rise
before me.
</p>

<p>
The savage looked around him, and suddenly
turning his dromedary, rode straight towards my
place of concealment.  I grasped my hoe, resolved
if he had seen me, not to yield up my wretched
existence without a desperate struggle; but all
unconscious of my presence, his sable majesty
dismounted, placed his asseguy against the chestnut
tree, spread a grass-mat at its root, and seating
himself, proceeded quietly to light a species of
hubble-bubble, or pipe made from a reed and a nut-shell.
Stuffing therein some dried herbs, he applied flint
and steel, and began leisurely and literally to enjoy
his morning weed.
</p>

<p>
At his neck I could see poor Robert Hartly's gold
locket glittering.
</p>

<p>
The vicinity of this ferocious and tremendous
personage, with the chances of his horde being all
within hail, like the band of Roderick Dhu, so
greatly alarmed me, that fully a quarter of an hour
elapsed before I rallied sufficiently to conceive the
idea of appropriating his quiet and docile dromedary
(which was cropping the herbage close by), and
using it as a means of reaching Cape Coast Castle,
the western goal of all my hopes.
</p>

<p>
I knew that this animal was deemed a miracle of
swiftness even in that burning clime, where they will
travel with ease fifty miles per day.
</p>

<p>
The savage King seemed to be asleep, or in a
waking doze; but I knew that by habits of danger,
activity, and a life spent in the open air, the senses of
these people were so acute, that the slightest sound
would revive him; and that, if once discovered, he
could crush me like a shrimp in his powerful grasp.
</p>

<p>
"Can I not kill him?" thought I, as furious
thoughts began to fill my mind; "my hoe is too
light&mdash;ha! the stone!"
</p>

<p>
I snatched the stone, which with difficulty I had
conveyed up the tree overnight, as a missile against
wild animals, and poised it in my hands.  It was
nearly twelve pounds weight, and the woolly skull of
the King was immediately below me; but it might
be thick as that of an elephant, so the missile would
prove more harmless than a ball of worsted.
</p>

<p>
If I missed, death to me was certain; if I slew
or stunned him, I had an equal certainty of escape.
Then I thought of poor Captain Baylis, of his
tortured wife, of Hartly, and of that horrible
butchery by the steep rocks of the river Gabon, and
a glow of merciless fury filled my soul!
</p>

<p>
The stone shot from my hand, and, bathed in
blood, quivering and senseless, the brutal King of
the Snake River rolled among the long dry grass,
with foam issuing from his mouth, and the aperture
below it.
</p>

<p>
Swift as lightning I descended the tree&mdash;all
cramped and stiff by a night passed amid its
branches; caught his dromedary by the bridle,
sprang upon its back, snatched up the asseguy as a
weapon for defence, and, without casting a glance to
ascertain whether I had been guilty of actual regicide,
or had merely given him a crack upon his imperial
crown, urged the animal I bestrode westward at
furious speed, through a grove of pale green orange
trees, where the rich dewy fruit hung like balls of
gleaming gold in the light of the morning sun.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap46"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XLVI.
<br /><br />
FLIGHT CONTINUED.
</h3>

<p>
Steering my course westward, so closely as I
could judge, I rode rapidly through wild and
pathless places; and when mounted on an animal so sure
and swift of foot, I felt more confident of escape
from any savages in whose way I might fall.
</p>

<p>
I was not without a dread of wild animals, for
the furious lion and the stealthy panther roam
everywhere through the forests of Africa; and
though nearly the whole day passed without meeting
one of either species, hundreds of pernicious serpents,
black, or brown, or green and scaly, with glaring
eyes, hissed at me from amid the long rank grass;
while brightly pinioned birds flew about me, and
horrid baboons and monkeys, of all kinds and sizes,
leaped and frisked on every hand, springing from
branch to branch of the trees, where they swung
madly to and fro by their tails as I passed.
</p>

<p>
At a distance rose the smoke of fires, with the
dome-shaped wigwams of three negro villages; but
these I avoided by keeping far off, and without
tarrying a moment for food or refreshment, pushed
on westward, through a broad plain where the maize,
cassava, and pulse were cultivated in little patches.
On, on where the banana, the papaw, the lemon,
orange, and tamarind trees grew wild in thickets;
where the spotted giraffe, the striped zebra, and
the graceful little antelope, made their lair, and
trembled when they heard the roar of the lion of
Libya.
</p>

<p>
On, on I rode to reach the castle of Cape Coast,
and urged the dromedary to his utmost speed.
</p>

<p>
Leaving the plain, at the end of which the sun
was setting now, I continued my way still westward
across a long tract of desert sand; and now for the
first time I paused to look around me.
</p>

<p>
On the borders of this desert grew some wild
lotus trees.  Dismounting, I took some of their
farinaceous berries with joy to assuage my hunger,
and found their flavour to resemble sweet ginger-bread.
</p>

<p>
After a draught of water from a runnel&mdash;water
that was actually tepid&mdash;I remounted with difficulty,
as my strength was nearly gone now; having ridden
the livelong day under a burning sun, which left
the sand so hot that it scorched my feet, while the
finely pulverized grains of it were floating in a
cloud about me, and filling my mouth and eyes as
it whirled in eddies when the faint evening wind
passed over the arid waste, rippling up its surface as
if it was water.
</p>

<p>
At a distance appeared some bustards and long-legged
cranes; but no other living thing, as the
setting sun, vast, round, and blood-red, after
shedding a steady crimson glare across the desert
waste, sank beneath the horizon.
</p>

<p>
At the quarter of his declension, I perceived a
grove of trees, and fearing to remain all night on
the open waste, rode swiftly towards them; but they
were farther off than I imagined, and seemed to
recede as I progressed, so deceptive is the distance
of a level sandy desert; thus night was far advanced
when I reached the shelter of their foliage, and
overcome by a lassitude&mdash;a total prostration&mdash;there
was no resisting, I had just strength sufficient to
throw the bridle of the dromedary over the branch
of a tree, and to roll off his back upon a bank of
soft turf, when a heavy sleep fell on me.
</p>

<p>
Waking next morning, stiff, cramped, and drenched
with dew, I looked round for my four-footed friend,
but he had disappeared, and not a trace of him
remained.
</p>

<p>
Thus, after all the toil and travelling of the past
day, my prospects were little better than before.
</p>

<p>
But the forest scene was lovely!  It was full of
scarlet and golden blossoms, all bright as the
glossy plumage of the parrots that nestled amid the
foliage; while the perfume of the orange and lemon
trees, which the dew of the past night had refreshed,
filled the morning air with delicious fragrance; and
now the mighty hum of a myriad great insects
loaded it with monotonous and perpetual sound.
</p>

<p>
On the outskirts of the wood, between me and
the far-stretching vista of the white sandy desert,
my eye suddenly detected the tall dark figure of a
savage, stalking about with a long asseguy in his
right hand.  He was naked, all save a scanty scarlet
grass-cloth around his body.
</p>

<p>
Coiled up in my lurking-place, I watched with
considerable interest the motions of this man of
the wilderness.  Supple, brawny, and strong, he had
the form of a bronze Hercules, the agility of an
antelope, and the eye of an eagle.  He had detected
the footmarks of the dromedary, and gliding about,
with a light stealthy step, and a keen prowling eye,
he tracked them with his face near the ground,
until he came close to where I lay, but never, the
while, did he venture <i>within</i> the actual boundary of
the wood.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly his eye fell upon me!
</p>

<p>
He started; uttered a shrill cry, and poised his
long asseguy, as if about to launch it; then he
lowered it, and uttered a whoop, which brought
some twenty or thirty other savages around him.
</p>

<p>
They all pointed to me in a manner and with
expressions that seemed to indicate surprise or rage;
they gesticulated violently, and by what they said,
I could learn that by being <i>within</i> the forest, I was
guilty of an act of sacrilege.  Their language
seemed a dialect of that spoken by the tribe I had
lied from, on the north bank of the Gabon.
</p>

<p><a id="chap47"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XLVII.
<br /><br />
THE WOOD OF THE DEVIL.
</h3>

<p>
Making signs that I was a friend, or wished to be
considered one, by casting away my asseguy, and
placing my hands upon my head and breast, I
advanced with a resolute aspect, but with a quaking
heart, towards them.
</p>

<p>
By what I heard then, and learned afterwards, I
had violated the sanctity of a holy place&mdash;the abode
of a fetish&mdash;as this wood had for ages been dedicated
to the Devil, whom these savages, like those
of Benin, worship as a dreadful spirit, not to love,
but to conciliate.
</p>

<p>
No one entered this wood, which was composed
of giant chestnuts, palm, orange, and lime trees, all
growing wild for many leagues, as the spirit of evil
was alleged to harbour in its inmost recesses.
</p>

<p>
Here then, on its skirts, a mother and her infant
were sometimes sacrificed with tortures too terrible
for description, to propitiate this dark spirit; though
in some rare instances a husband might ransom his
doomed wife with a poor female slave, captured from
a hostile tribe.
</p>

<p>
So sacred is this wood deemed, that if a person
accidentally enters it by one path, he must force his
way through it to the very end without turning or
looking back&mdash;a feat none ever performed, as it
teems with wild beasts, whose fangs and claws
speedily dispose of the intruder.  Even a foreign
<i>negro</i>, or his wives, dare not enter it; then, what
punishment was due to me, a white man, for having
ventured to do so?
</p>

<p>
Dapper, a very old traveller, and a bold fellow,
too, mentions that, to ridicule the faith of the
people in this forest, he went shooting into it, and
deliberately turned <i>back</i> when about half way
through.
</p>

<p>
"What will the Devil think of this?" he asked
the negro priests, who were scared by his audacity,
and confounded by his return in safety.
</p>

<p>
"He does not trouble himself about white men,"
was their response; and, singular to say, our
traveller was permitted to go unscathed, for savages
generally admire courage and temerity.
</p>

<p>
However, the negroes into whose hands I had
unfortunately fallen seemed of a different opinion
from Mr. Dapper's friends; and after a noisy
palaver, to which I listened with an agonizing
interest, my life being in the balance, they laid
violent hands upon me.
</p>

<p>
I was dragged to a tall palm-tree, which grew on
the verge of the forest, with some of its fibrous
roots extending among the grassy border on one
side, and into the dry sand of the desert on the other.
</p>

<p>
I was placed with my back against the stem; and
there they bound me hard and fast by drawing my
arms round it and tying my wrists securely by the
tendrils of a convolvolus&mdash;one of the climbing kind,
which, when tough and green, is strong as a new
inch-rope.
</p>

<p>
They then retired, mocking and grinning, and ever
and anon threatening to launch their asseguys at
me; thus I fully expected to be martyred like
St. Sebastian, as we see him in Guido's picture at
Dulwich; but they left me, and disappeared round
an angle of the forest, abandoning me to my fate and
my own terrible reflections.
</p>

<p>
It was midday now, and above me shone the
blaze of an almost vertical sun; thus I found the
shade of the drooping palm branches grateful and
pleasant&mdash;a boon, a blessing.
</p>

<p>
Lest the savages might be watching me from a
distance, I did not attempt to release my hands;
but after nearly an hour elapsed, fearing that
strength might fail me from the cramped manner
in which my arms were bound backward round the
tree, I strove to rend the green withes which
fettered me to it.
</p>

<p>
Vain task!
</p>

<p>
Strain them as I might, the tough and unyielding
tendrils of the convolvoli only seemed to tighten,
and to cut me as I tore, wrenched, and struggled,
without success.
</p>

<p>
The horror of being left thus defenceless at the
mercy of the wild animals with which the forest
teemed was so great, that I forgot alike the pangs
of hunger and those of thirst, which are greater still;
and again and again strove frantically for freedom,
until, with the futility of each successive effort, the
conviction forced itself upon me, that without
human assistance I could never be released, but
might perish of starvation, or be devoured alive.
</p>

<p>
Human assistance! who, then, would be disposed
to aid me?  And, if so, who would come in
time?
</p>

<p>
And so the hot day passed breathlessly, slowly,
and terribly on!
</p>

<p>
As the burning sun revolved towards the West,
the lengthening shadows of the wood went round in
the reverse direction, until the level sunbeams cast
them far across the arid desert I had traversed so
swiftly yesterday; and as the light of evening sank,
the hues of that white glistening waste changed to
yellow, then to brown, and then to amber.
</p>

<p>
My arms ached till they seemed in process of
being rent from my shoulders: so, panting, hot,
breathless, and half dead with thirst, I reclined
against that abhorred tree, from which I could in
no way free myself.
</p>

<p>
As evening deepened, the hum of insect life lessened,
and the bright-plumed birds of the wilderness
were seeking their nests in the foliage above me;
but on me their beauty was lost.  Even the cock
of the Libyan forest, with his purple breast, his
crimson and green pinions, was unheeded, as he
picked up a few grains of millet at my feet, and
passed to his mate in the orange tree.
</p>

<p>
A raven or two, soaring through the blue immensity
of the sky, suggested dreadful thoughts of
what I <i>might be</i> on the morrow.
</p>

<p>
Then little snakes came from amid the long grass
to writhe and wriggle on the sand, which was yet
warm with the sunshine of the past day; and they
made me think of the dreadful cobra-capello, with
his flamelike tongue, charged with poison and
death&mdash;the hooded serpent, which, when in fury, has
been known to rear its horrid front, and spring at a
man on horseback; and then of the berg-adder,
which I feared still more, because it is so difficult to
discover, and which I had no means of avoiding if
it approached me.
</p>

<p>
My past reading had given me, moreover, a somewhat
exaggerated idea of the number of wild animals
in Africa.  At Ascension, I had seen a narrative of
a <i>Voyage à l'Isle de France</i>, by a person who
styled himself an <i>Officier du Roi</i>, and who stated
that, in the forests of Africa, "there were to be
found whole <i>armies</i> of lions."
</p>

<p>
Later travellers have ridiculed this idea, but be
that as it may, the distant roaring of a lion now
added to the accumulating dangers which surrounded
me, and filled my soul with emotions of horror so
great that I could not summon even a thought of
prayer, and memory refused to supply me with the
most hackneyed ejaculation of piety.
</p>

<p>
Bound and helpless, without means of defence
or flight, I now heard this terrible animal approaching
me, crushing the shrubs and branches in his
native forest as he came.
</p>

<p>
On hearing this sound, so fraught with danger, a
zebra and several antelopes bounded out of the wood
and paused to listen.  Again that prolonged cry
rang upon the still air.  The zebra cowered and
shuddered, and after crouching for a moment, sprang
away into the desert of sand, followed by the fleet
little antelopes (which were of the kind called Guinea
Deer, having legs no thicker than a tobacco-pipe),
and they were all soon out of sight.
</p>

<p>
The roar was singular in sound.  Hoarse and
inarticulate, it swelled upon the air like a prolonged O,
that seemed to come from and pass to a vast distance.
It never became loud or shrill, but the <i>idea</i>
it suggested of the animal itself, made it seem to
pierce the very soul; and all the tales I had read or
heard of the lion, and all the terrors I had conjured
up as being embodied in his tremendous person, came
upon me like a flood.
</p>

<p>
There are some who aver that if he has once
tasted human flesh he will for ever disdain any
other.
</p>

<p>
With great bewilderment of mind&mdash;like one in a
dream that is full of nightmare&mdash;I beheld a great
and dark-skinned lion, with an enormous dusky
mane, run out of the wood about a hundred yards off,
and, after looking about, he came straight towards me,
for by some strange instinct he became sensible of
my vicinity in a moment.  In his mouth he bore a
zebra (about the size of a Shetland pony), which he
grasped by its crushed back, and the legs of which
were trailing on the ground as he bore it along,
with all the air and all the ease of a cat carrying off
a large rat.
</p>

<p>
On beholding me he dropped his prey, which was
quite dead, and after uttering another hoarse roar,
continued to approach, with his nose close to the
ground, while switching his tufted tail and shaking
his shaggy mane, preparatory, as I imagined, to
making a spring upon me; then I closed my eyes,
and with a heart that died within me, resigned
myself to my fate.
</p>

<p>
Onward he came, step by step, for I could hear his
footfalls on the ground!
</p>

<p>
Onward yet, and now every pulse seemed to stand
still!
</p>

<p>
Then a warm and fetid breath played upon my
face, I felt his whiskers touch my breast, and there
was a strange snuffing sound in my tingling ears.
</p>

<p>
Opening my eyes, I beheld close to mine the
tremendous visage of the lion, the enormous upper
lip, in form so suggestive of cruelty and rapacity,
and all studded with wiry hairs, bristling out
fiercely on either side; the low flat forehead and
impending brows; the wild orbs that seemed to glare
from amid the masses of his tangled mane; the open
jaws and sharp teeth, reeking and steaming with
the warm blood of the zebra he had just slain!
</p>

<p>
After deliberately snuffing at me in this manner
for a second or so&mdash;a time which seemed an eternity,
so much agony of thought and tension of the heart
were compressed within it, he quietly <i>turned about</i>,
took his dead zebra, as if he deemed it the most
preferable supper of the two, trotted into the wood
and disappeared.
</p>

<p>
The agonies of a lifetime seemed concentrated into
that minute!
</p>

<p>
All I had endured now proved too much for me.
A sudden insensibility sank like a cloud over all
my senses, and a sleep&mdash;the sleep of utter
prostration of mind and body, fell upon me.  Thus, the
noon of the next day was far advanced before I
became again conscious, or aware of my miserable
existence.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XLVIII.
<br /><br />
RETAKEN.
</h3>

<p>
Released from the tree, but still benumbed and
sore after being so long bound to it, I was now
stretched upon the grass, under the shadow of its
great fan-like branches.  Many persons were moving
about me, and the hum of their voices filled my
ear.
</p>

<p>
Raising myself slowly and heavily upon my
hands, I saw around me hundreds of negroes,
and close to mine was the ugly visage of&mdash;Amoo.
</p>

<p>
"Oh," thought I, bitterly; "this is too much!
A prisoner again, and after all the dangers I have
dared&mdash;the friends I have seen perish&mdash;the miseries
I have undergone!  Will fate never weary of
persecuting me?"
</p>

<p>
But Amoo was not such a wicked fellow after all.
</p>

<p>
Producing his gourd bottle of palm wine, he
mixed it with cool water from a shaded spring,
and forced me to imbibe a long draught, after
which I sat up and looked about me more
collectedly.
</p>

<p>
I was in the midst of a species of negro
bivouac, consisting of many hundreds of men and
women, with camels and dromedaries laden with
various stuffs and rudely fashioned weapons and
utensils, made up in bales with grass matting and
cordage.
</p>

<p>
They were cooking at several fires, and in various
modes, the flesh of an elephant which they had
snared, as Amoo informed me, in a pit on the other
side of the forest on the preceding day, and the
meat of which is esteemed in these latitudes as a
veritable dainty&mdash;a right royal luxury.  He pressed
me to eat a slice or so, but in my weak state, and
the fever of my spirit, the odour and the aspect of
it were more than enough for me, so a mouthful or
two of boiled yam and palm wine sufficed.
</p>

<p>
The negroes were all well armed with asseguys,
swords, bows, muskets, and targets, as if proceeding
on a hostile expedition.  Among them were many
who were better clad and more civilized in aspect
than the painted savages who dwell by the Snake
River, and these, Amoo informed me, were subjects
of the King of Benin.
</p>

<p>
After relating how his companions had found me
bound to the tree, senseless or asleep, he inquired
how it came to pass I was there.
</p>

<p>
"I fled to escape your wife," said I, looking
round fearfully.
</p>

<p>
"Yah, yah," said he, laughing; "I was sorry
for the loss of my white slave, but am glad you
escaped her knife; for she wished much to ornament
her big canoe, so she got the head of another white
man."
</p>

<p>
"Another&mdash;who&mdash;which?"
</p>

<p>
"Amoo does not know; he tried to steal a canoe
and escape to the Pongo Islands, but was retaken,
and so my wife got his head for her canoe.  She
boiled it in a stone pipkin, with gums and herbs,
stuck fish-bones in its nose and ears, and now it
will last for many, many suns and moons, without
decay."
</p>

<p>
(Who was this <i>other</i> unfortunate that had
perished so miserably?  He might be my friend
Hartly&mdash;if indeed it was not he who was so cruelly
destroyed in the basket of thorns.)
</p>

<p>
"Never mind who it was," said Amoo, divining
my thoughts, "since you are found again."
</p>

<p>
"To be your prisoner?" I sighed.
</p>

<p>
Amoo grinned, leered cunningly, and shook his
woolly head.
</p>

<p>
"What then?"
</p>

<p>
"To be reserved for something better than being
my slave."
</p>

<p>
"<i>Better!</i>" I reiterated, with perplexity; "how&mdash;where?"
</p>

<p>
"Yah, yah&mdash;you will learn in good time."
</p>

<p>
"When?" I exclaimed, with impatience.
</p>

<p>
"On our reaching the capital of Benin."
</p>

<p>
"You are going there with all these people?"
</p>

<p>
"Yah."
</p>

<p>
"For what purpose&mdash;to fight?"
</p>

<p>
"No."
</p>

<p>
"What then?"
</p>

<p>
"To bury Zabadie, the king, who is dead."
</p>

<p>
I was somewhat comforted by this, as everything
added to the chances of escape; for I knew that
European vessels frequently anchored in the Bight
of Benin, and I associated ideas of greater civilization
with that quarter of Africa, though it bordered
on Dahomey&mdash;that barbarous land of blood and
terror.
</p>

<p>
It was evident that Amoo knew nothing about
my encounter in the wood with the King, his brother,
or the manner in which I had borrowed the royal
dromedary; for he informed me, in the course of
our obscure and somewhat pantomimic conversation,
that on his return he would probably find himself
King of the Snake River, as his brother was not
expected to live.
</p>

<p>
I inquired why.
</p>

<p>
"As he was asleep under a tree, a great baboon
let a big stone fall upon his head, and nearly killed
him," replied Amoo, with perfect unconcern, and I
cannot plead guilty to feeling the smallest
compunction in the matter.
</p>

<p>
This species of caravan was proceeding from the
territory of Gabon, whose king is a vassal of the
monarch of Benin, with a tribute of female slaves,
baskets, gourd vessels, panther skins, elephants'
teeth, and gold dust, to assist at the funeral of the
late royal defunct, or to lay at the feet of his
successor; and I was pleased to find that we were to
proceed as nearly as possible along the coast.
</p>

<p>
I resolved to take the first opportunity of securing
arms&mdash;a musket and knife if possible&mdash;of leaving
the cavalcade, and concealing myself in a wood near
the sea-shore, there to await a ship; but the hope
was formed in vain, for Amoo, who frequently spoke
of the "great future in store for me at Benin,"
never lost sight of me for an instant, either by night
or by day, when we halted.
</p>

<p>
When we did so, we warily lighted a circle of
large fires to scare wild animals from our bivouac.
and thus could sleep in security.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap49"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XLIX.
<br /><br />
THE CARAVAN.
</h3>

<p>
The whole of the coast there is broken by innumerable
river estuaries, the banks of which are covered
by bright green reeds, and broad-leaved weeds and
canes of mighty growth.  Thus our progress was
slow, as we had frequently to embark in canoes on
those frowsy waters, whose miasma is so pestilential
by night, and which are ever rendered dangerous by
the alligators and hippopotami that lurk in the
oozy holes along their banks.
</p>

<p>
At a place where we were about to cross, the
black scouts, who formed a species of advanced
guard, returned in haste and excitement to state
that one of the last-named animals (one of great
size, too) was asleep on the bank.
</p>

<p>
On hearing this the caravan halted, and Amoo,
being a brave and hardy warrior, and moreover the
brother of a king, claimed the privilege of assailing
it.  Armed with a spear made specially for the
purpose, he advanced to the enterprise, accompanied
only by one companion and by me, to whom he
relinquished for a time his gaily painted bow and
quiver of poisoned arrows.
</p>

<p>
I had heard so much of those fierce and unwieldy
monsters, that I followed him with considerable
interest and curiosity as we shouldered and pushed
a passage through a dense and leafy jungle of gigantic
weeds, prickly yams, serrated grass, and reeds of
enormous height, which flourished amid the deep
quagmire that bordered the broad bosom of this
majestic but nameless river, whose waters are now
rolling, as they have rolled for ages, into the Gulf
of Guinea.
</p>

<p>
On forcing our way through a wall of reeds, we
suddenly came upon the hippopotamus, which was
lying on his left side, asleep in the sunshine, and
stretched at full length upon a piece of greensward,
where, probably, he had been grazing overnight.
</p>

<p>
The aspect of this mis-shapen monster, which
was about fourteen feet long&mdash;his singular form, a
great round body with short elephantine legs, a
broad, square head and stunted tail&mdash;was as repulsive
as the size of his great cavernous mouth with
its terrible incisors was appalling.
</p>

<p>
He slept soundly, however, so Amoo, gliding
stealthily as a serpent, approached until within
seven feet of where he lay, snoring heavily, and
basking in the hot and breathless sunshine.
</p>

<p>
With a dexterity which my poor old friend Hans
Peterkin would have appreciated highly, Amoo, with
a line, attached to his spear a light wooden float
which serves to show where the animal lurks when
he takes the water after being struck; then, while
the attending warrior stood near to hand a second
lance, Amoo raised his sinewy form on tiptoe, poised
his barbed weapon, and hurled it, whizzing, with
singular force and dexterity, full at the sleeping
animal.
</p>

<p>
Deep through the thick, dark hide sunk the
pointed spear, until its iron head was completely
buried.  At the moment it left his hand, Amoo, an
agile and practised huntsman, sprang backward
several paces; but not so his unfortunate companion,
on whom the awakened monster leaped with the
weight of an elephant united to the fury of a
panther, and in an instant crushed him to death in
his enormous jaws, doubling up the body and grinding
ribs and legs together till they were churned
into a mass of blood.
</p>

<p>
Then plunging into the river, he disappeared,
leaving the water covered with froth and bloody
ripples, that ran in circles to either shore; but still
the little buoy attached to the spear or harpoon
floated and bobbed up and down to indicate where he
lay writhing among the weeds and beds of bright blue
coral far down below&mdash;for the coral is blue there.
</p>

<p>
Amoo's shrill cries brought several negroes to his
assistance; and these, enraged by the sudden death
of their friend, began to haul sturdily on the line,
which was a good English rope, obtained from some
passing ship by theft or barter; this irritated the
wounded animal, so he came surging, bleeding, and
frothing to the surface again, when a dozen spears,
whizzing through the air, were launched by
unerring hands, and he was soon slain, and amid
exulting yells, whooping, and beating of tum-tums,
was hauled close in shore among the reeds, and
there, as he was too bulky to be pulled entirely out
of the water, was cut up in large pieces and placed in
baskets on the backs of the camels, dromedaries, and
slaves.
</p>

<p>
Amoo declared this prey was too full-grown, and
consequently too fat for eating; but added, that his
"skin would make excellent whips."
</p>

<p>
This was the <i>fifth</i> he had slain&mdash;thus he equalled
Commodus who slew five in the amphitheatre.
</p>

<p>
The country through which we travelled was low,
flat, and thickly wooded; thus we seldom saw the
sea; yet, when glimpses of its bright blue waters,
stretching to the horizon far away, came before us
at times through the groves of orange, lime, and
palm trees, or through valleys where the white tufts
of the cotton buds flecked the greenness of the
luxuriant scenery, how anxiously, how affectionately
I gazed upon it, for it was the high road to my
home&mdash;the way to freedom and dear old England!
</p>

<p>
After travelling many days, until I was almost
sinking with fatigue, by the intense heat of the
atmosphere and the number of things I was compelled
(as a slave) to carry, we came at last in sight
of the great city of Benin, which stretches far along
the right bank of the river Formosa.
</p>

<p>
I hailed it with emotions of undisguised joy, for
Amoo had been daily recurring to the liberty and
honours that were in store for me there.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap50"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER L.
<br /><br />
WE REACH THE CAPITAL.
</h3>

<p>
I resolved while life remained to persevere to the
last in attempting an escape.
</p>

<p>
"'I shall never succeed,' is often the parent of
failure" (to quote Isaac Taylor when writing on
character).  "'I will not try any more,' ensures
disappointment.  'It is all <i>chance</i>, and I am not in
luck,' most commonly leads to disgrace."
</p>

<p>
Calling his words to memory, I resolved to trust
to none of these fatal phrases, for I had passed
through too many perils not to hope that a few
more might be surmounted.
</p>

<p>
An old writer says, "The King of Benin has
men in pay to furnish travellers with water, and
these keep great pots full of that which is fresh
and clear at convenient distances, with a shell
to drink it out of; but no person must take a drop
without paying for it; and if the waterman is
absent, they drink, leave the money, and pursue their
way."
</p>

<p>
It may have been so when old Dapper wrote or
romanced, but not a drop of water found we on the
weary track to quench our burning thirst, save in
stagnant tarns by the wayside.
</p>

<p>
It was towards the close of a day when we had
been nearly choked by the sulphurous heat which
filled the air after a violent thunderstorm, that we
approached the city of Benin, and saw its long lines
of huts, or wigwams, each one story high, covering
for many miles the right bank of the Formosa, one
of the greatest estuaries which disgorge their waters
into the Bight of Benin.
</p>

<p>
Groves of beautiful wood, orange, lime trees, cotton
and pepper bushes, spread along the banks of the
river, and many floating islets, covered with flowers
and unknown fruit trees, are constantly borne past
by its waters, from the unexplored lands through
which they flow.
</p>

<p>
The city and its walls too were unlike aught I
had ever seen before; yet their extent was great, and
the dusky hordes that peopled them are probably
unnumbered and unknown.
</p>

<p>
We were admitted through a wooden gate in the
ramparts, which were composed of the trunks of trees
pegged together, as palisades are in America, but
loopholed for arrows or musketry; and the guard at
this gate, as at all the others, was composed entirely
of women armed with bows, lances, and old firelocks,
for, like his royal brother of Dahomey, the sovereign
of Benin has somewhere about four thousand wives,
whom he has armed and formed into troops, and
who&mdash;when off duty&mdash;make crocks, pots, and pipkins
of clay, from the sale of which he derives his
principal revenue.
</p>

<p>
They were all stout and handsome negresses,
attired in a species of petticoat which reached below
the knee, with a vest to cover the breast; their hair
was dyed into alternate red and white locks, and
they had great rings of polished metal on their
otherwise bare arms.
</p>

<p>
Through this guarded gate our long cavalcade of
laden camels, dromedaries, negroes, and slaves,
passed down a populous street of great width, and
nearly three miles in length.  The houses, or huts,
on either side, were alike singular in aspect and
construction, being built of red clay, and having
behind or around them spacious gardens and shady
groves of lime and orange trees.  Vast crowds of
male and female blacks followed us, but in solemn
silence, as the cavalcade bore a double tribute to the
dead king and his successor, towards whose royal
palace&mdash;if the odd collection of fantastic buildings
could so be called&mdash;we now proceeded.
</p>

<p>
We passed through a kind of square, which Amoo
described to me as the market-place; and there the
king's female guards were exposing for sale great
quantities of their clay pots and pipkins, gourd
bottles, calibash basons, wooden spoons and ladles of
all sorts and sizes, at their own prices; for these
industrious Amazons enjoyed the entire monopoly of
this branch of trade; and as a hint that none might
interfere with them, there hung by iron hooks upon
a gibbet the headless bodies of four men, in a
frightful state of decay, with turkey buzzards feeding on
the fragments that dropped from them, as they
sweltered in the burning sunshine.
</p>

<p>
In the centre of this market-place rose a pyramid
some twenty feet high, formed entirely of human
skulls, bleached white as snow by the alternate rain
and sun&mdash;a ghastly and terrible trophy of barbarism
and cruelty, which reminded me of stories I had
read of old Mexico, where similar monuments
adorned the cities of the Incas; or of the tower
formed of the skulls of slaughtered Christians, now
standing in the Mohammedan isle of Gerba.
</p>

<p>
Fascinated by this revolting spectacle, I passed
on with the dusky multitude; and Amoo informed
me (while all prostrated their ugly faces in the
dust) that we stood at the gate of the king's
palace!
</p>

<p>
It was a vast collection of rambling wooden
houses, which formed the dwellings of the sovereign,
his wives, fiadoors, or officials, stables for his horses
and dromedaries, dens for slaves or prisoners (a
commodity with which he seldom troubled himself),
magazines for stores and plunder.  These edifices
extended for nearly a mile before us; and on all those
quaint buildings, which were barbarously adorned
with the bones and horns of animals, a grinning
human skull was the chief ornament.
</p>

<p>
Through a barrier <i>manned</i> by a motley multitude
of female guards, many of whom were armed with
bayonets and old brass-butted Tower muskets,
which may have done service under Moore and
Wellington, we were conducted into a court
surrounded by copper figures, so monstrous in aspect
and conception, that the eye laboured in vain to
discover whether they were meant to represent men,
beasts, or birds.
</p>

<p>
The crowd who followed were all well armed with
spears, bows and arrows, which, as Amoo informed
me, were duly poisoned by the <i>fetishers</i>, or priests.
Many of the fiadoors wore gay dresses of Dutch
scarlet cloth, caps edged with civet fur, and
necklaces of jasper and fine coral, or rings of yellow
copper, bracelets of lions' teeth, and bucklers of
rhinoceros hide.
</p>

<p>
Round this court were wooden pillars, curiously
carved and painted, and, in some instances, covered
with plates of engraved copper&mdash;the hieroglyphical
records of battles, victories, and massacres&mdash;the
edifices were roofed with palm canes, and had
many fantastic pinnacles, surmounted by human
skulls, or birds dried and prepared, with their
pinions outspread.
</p>

<p>
In the centre of the court, about twenty negroes,
captured from some hostile tribe, were digging a
deep hole, like a vast grave, with wooden shovels;
and they grinned at us malevolently as we passed
them.
</p>

<p>
Amoo now told me "that the time was come to
which he had so often referred, when a great honour
would be conferred on me, and when we must part."
</p>

<p>
I knew not what all this meant, but bewildered
by the scenes through which I had passed, the
strange places in which I found myself, wearied by
the toil of our journey, choked by dust and heat
almost to fainting, I resigned myself to the custody
of the negress guard, and left Amoo, whom hitherto
I had considered a species of protector.  Perceiving
the dejected state I was in, he gave me a draught
from his gourd bottle; and as I was thrust into my
prison, and the door of it closed upon me, I saw
for the last time save once, the dark visage of this
friendly savage, who never forgot that I had rescued
his child from the baboon.
</p>

<p>
The wooden door was secured upon me; the hum
of guttural voices died away as the cavalcade passed
on to some other portion of this vast and rambling
habitation of barbarous royalty; then I was left to
my own reflections, and partly in the dark; at
least, there was just sufficient light to enable me to
see a pile of straw, or dried river grass, on which I
threw myself in weariness, if not in despair, as I
knew not what new misfortune fate had in store
for me.
</p>

<p>
Sleep, oblivion, I courted in vain.  I was now,
though exhausted, in too high a state of nervous
excitement for sleep; and as my eyes became
accustomed to the dim twilight of my prison, I could
perceive the chamber to be fashioned of the trunks
of trees, squared, smoothed, and pegged together,
and then painted with barbarous figures.  Above
the door by which I had entered were three human
skulls, placed upon the hoofs of hippopotami, as
brackets.
</p>

<p>
A sound as of something rustling in a distant
corner attracted my attention.  I approached, and
saw upon a pile of straw and dry leaves a white
man extended at full length, and almost destitute
of clothing.
</p>

<p>
I drew nearer softly, for I knew not whether
this new companion in misfortune might be alive
or dead.
</p>

<p>
Then imagine what were my emotions on discovering
him to be my friend, sunk in a profound
slumber&mdash;my old friend, Robert Hartly, captain of
the fated <i>Leda</i>.
</p>

<p><a id="chap51"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER LI.
<br /><br />
AN OLD FRIEND IN A NEW PLACE.
</h3>

<p>
The pallor of his countenance, his wasted form, and
sunken features shocked me, for I was quite
unaware or heedless that he would find an equal ravage
in my own appearance.  His beard and hair grew in
matted masses about his sunburnt face, and his
once stout and manly hands were thin and wan as
those of a consumptive girl.
</p>

<p>
I shook his shoulder; he awoke, and turned
listlessly to me at first; then with a strange cry of
mingled joy and grief, he exclaimed&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Jack!"
</p>

<p>
"Bob&mdash;Bob Hartly!"
</p>

<p>
Such was all we could utter for some seconds
as each clasped and shook the hands of the other.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Jack Manly," he exclaimed, in a broken
voice, "I would rather see you in your grave than
in this place with me!"
</p>

<p>
"How&mdash;why&mdash;what do you mean?"
</p>

<p>
"My poor lad, you know not for what we are
reserved."
</p>

<p>
"Not&mdash;not to be killed and eaten?" said I, in a
low voice of dismay.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, worse than that.  Do you not know?"
</p>

<p>
"No."
</p>

<p>
"My poor friend&mdash;my poor friend!"
</p>

<p>
"What on earth can be worse than that?  Amoo
told me&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Who is Amoo?"
</p>

<p>
"A chief, the brother of the King of the Rio
Serpientes."
</p>

<p>
"The savage brother of a savage!  And he told
you&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"That I was reserved for the greatest honour?"
</p>

<p>
"Honours indeed!" reiterated Hartly, with a
bitter laugh.
</p>

<p>
"Yes."
</p>

<p>
"Did he add, you should have <i>liberty</i> to enjoy
your honours?"
</p>

<p>
"No."
</p>

<p>
"Air&mdash;breath&mdash;sunshine&mdash;light&mdash;life?"
</p>

<p>
"No!"
</p>

<p>
"I thought not, for these accursed savages are as
subtle and severe as they are cruel and sanguinary."
</p>

<p>
"What <i>do</i> you mean, Hartly?"
</p>

<p>
"That we are reserved for <i>burial alive</i>."
</p>

<p>
"Alive!"
</p>

<p>
"Yes&mdash;with their king who is just dead.  It is
the custom here to celebrate the obsequies of royal
personages&mdash;of kings especially&mdash;in a frantic and
barbarous manner.  Oh, Jack! after all we have
seen and suffered together, is it not cruel of fate to
persecute and finish us thus?  And is it not strange
that in this age of a civilized world such things
<i>can</i> be?"
</p>

<p>
"I will fight to the last!" I exclaimed, furiously.
</p>

<p>
"We have not a single weapon."
</p>

<p>
"But these female guards have plenty."
</p>

<p>
"The weakest among them is stronger than both
of us put together <i>now</i>," said he, despondingly.
</p>

<p>
"We must not perish thus, Hartly&mdash;we <i>shall</i>
escape!" said I, emphatically.
</p>

<p>
"But how?"
</p>

<p>
"Time will show&mdash;we were nearly as desperately
circumstanced when foul of the iceberg, or beset in
the field ice."
</p>

<p>
"We have still a few days for deliberation; but
meantime, tell me how you came here."
</p>

<p>
"I was brought to Benin by Amoo, who saved
me from dying of hunger, or by the teeth and claws
of wild animals in the Devil's wood, where some
savages found me concealed, and bound me hand
and foot by withes to a tree."
</p>

<p>
"Tell me all about this, Jack."
</p>

<p>
I related briefly all that had occurred to me since
we had been separated at the cliff above the Gabon,
where three of our hapless party perished; the
destruction of poor Captain Baylis and his wife;
and how I feared that he, Hartly, was the seaman
who had been tortured in the basket of thorns; of
my slavery with Amoo, and his squaw's felonious
intentions with regard to my head; of my flight
and recapture&mdash;to all of which he listened with
varying expressions of anger and honest grief, for
the loss of so many brave English seamen.
</p>

<p>
"And now, Bob," added I, "for your own story."
</p>

<p>
"I have little to relate that is not similar to what
you have told me.  On that fatal day when our
boat's crew were captured, and we were separated, I
was given by the King to a fetisher, or priest, a
hideous old fellow who was covered with tattooing,
and wore a copper ring in each of his ears, and had
the dorsal fin of a shark through his nose, in
sprit-sail-yard fashion.
</p>

<p>
"He employed me as his 'slavey,' in making and
pointing arrows for the warriors, as the manufacture
of that commodity is a perquisite, or portion of the
priestly trade in Gabon, for the tips of the arrows
are poisoned by a combination of herbs, of which
these fetishers alone possess, or pretend to possess,
the knowledge, and with true priestcraft take
especial good care to keep the secret among themselves.
If the monstrous negro race hereabout have
any religion, it consists of an adoration of the Devil,
to whom they never tire of sacrificing wild animals,
and occasionally each other&mdash;which is a sacrifice of
much less consequence."
</p>

<p>
"Have they no belief in a Supreme Being?"
</p>

<p>
"They know that some power superior to themselves
created the skies and the earth; but because
He is not an evil, but a good spirit, they deem it
better policy to appease the Devil, and so they
work in <i>his</i> service with all their might; and from
all we have seen, they seem to have the gift of
doing so to the utmost.  My old master, the
fetisher, professed to be on very intimate terms
with Whirlwind Tom, and by his aid could always
foretell what was to happen."
</p>

<p>
"How?"
</p>

<p>
"He had an old pipkin perforated by three
holes, through which he alleged the Devil spoke to
him in whispers.  He was a vicious old wretch, and
on one occasion <i>bit me</i>, which was no joke, as his
teeth were all filed, till they were sharp as those
of a tiger cat.
</p>

<p>
"When not employed in selecting and cutting reeds
for arrows, or feathering, or pointing and poisoning
them, this fetisher made me fish for him in a
tributary of the Snake Elver, on the bank of which
he lived in a wigwam, which stood amid a grove of
mimosa trees; and it resembled a huge punch-bowl
or beehive, as it was built entirely of reeds and turf,
plastered over with mud, which the sunshine had
burned as white as Kentish chalk.
</p>

<p>
"There he led me a dog's life, for he was an
ill-tempered old savage, who hourly reviled, kicked, beat,
and spat upon me, and as my beard grew, he was
wont to snatch and tear it, a proceeding, you must
allow, very trying to one's temper.
</p>

<p>
"I perceived that we dwelt in a secluded place;
that, save a warrior who came from time to time
for a bundle of arrows, no one ever approached us,
so I resolved to escape.  In my fur socks, and a
species of cummerbund which my master permitted
me to wear, I secreted a good stock of fishing
apparatus, and selected a strong javelin with an iron
point, well steeped in those precious poisonous stuffs
which he was wont to brew in a pipkin.
</p>

<p>
"On the day I had finally made up my mind to
slip my cable and be off, we were cutting reeds for
arrow-shafts on the summit of a rock above the
Gabon River.  It was a lovely place, covered with
feathery fern, bright scarlet geraniums, and
flowering reeds, but I thought it looked very like the
place where I had last seen you, and where our
three shipmates perished in so barbarous a manner.
My heart became filled with wild and dark thoughts,
and I was neglecting my work, when suddenly my
beard was grasped by the old tattooed fetisher,
who squirted a whole quid of some stuff full in my
face, while raining a shower of blows upon my bare
back with a <i>sjambok</i>, or supple-jack, of rhinoceros
hide, which he always carried for my especial
benefit.
</p>

<p>
"Flesh and blood could stand this no longer.
</p>

<p>
"We were close to the brink of the rock which
overhung the stream that rolled about a hundred
feet below, so I gave his sooty reverence a vigorous
kick which shot him over like a crow, and souse he
went through the air, with arms outspread.
</p>

<p>
"Whether he swam, sank, or fed some hungry
crocodile, I know not, as I fled into the adjacent
forest, and after lurking there long&mdash;sleeping at
night in the trees, as many a time I had done on the
swinging topsail-yard&mdash;I began, like you, to make
for the coast to the westward, in the hope of seeing
a ship venture into the Bight, or bearing toward
the Pongos for fresh water.
</p>

<p>
"For many days and nights I wandered through
forests of oak, cypress, myrtle, and mimosa trees,
enduring constantly the terror of being devoured by
wild animals, or falling again among savages who
might force me to render a severe account of the
blessed fetisher I had kicked into the Gabon, till at
last I found myself in a stately wood of sea-pines
and <i>then</i> I saw the ocean&mdash;the brave old ocean,
Jack!&mdash;the broad turnpike that could lead us home&mdash;the
same ocean whose waves swept up by the Nore and
Greenwich Reach, to mingle their waters with the
Thames&mdash;and I laughed with joy, though its bosom
was glistening under the vertical sun that scorches
the coast of Guinea.
</p>

<p>
"All the memories of home and Old England
swelled up within me as I gazed upon the girdle of
her shores.  The sea! that
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "&mdash;&mdash;glorious mirror where the Almighty's form<br />
  Glasses itself in tempests; in all time,<br />
  Calm or convulsed&mdash;in breeze, or gale, or storm,<br />
  Icing the pole, or in the torrid clime<br />
  Dark-heaving;&mdash;boundless, endless, and sublime!"<br />

<h3>
CHAPTER LII.
<br /><br />
HARTLY'S STORY.
</h3>

<p>
"When night fell, I came out of the lonely forest
to gaze upon the moonlit sea&mdash;not that the forest
was very <i>lonely</i>, after all, as there seemed to be at
least fifty thousand baboons, monkeys, and squirrels,
which jabbered and leaped as if they had all gone
mad, the whole night, from tree to tree, and more
than once the roar of a lion came hollowly from a
distance, under the lower branches of the pines.
</p>

<p>
"I sat upon a piece of detached rock, and, to seek
for food, dropped my fishing-line into the water.
There I soon caught a fish, on which I breakfasted
next day, after spreading it, split open, on the rocks,
where it was half cooked by the burning sun.  As
for salt, there was plenty of that to be found among
the crevices, where the heat had burned up the
spray of the sea.
</p>

<p>
"For three nights I fished there with success
and safety.  On the third, I found at my line a fish
of strange aspect, and, sailor-like, had some doubts
about breakfasting on it, but hunger soon ends all
niceties.  When morning came, I sought a secluded
part of the wood, and thought of lighting a little
fire by rubbing dried branches together that I
might broil my fish.
</p>

<p>
"Now, unless I could produce ocular proof of what
I am about to say, you would laugh at me for telling
you a forecastle yarn, but the proof shall not be
wanting.
</p>

<p>
"While opening and cleaning the fish at a spring,
previous to broiling it (an almost epicurean process
to me), I found in its entrails&mdash;what?  MY RING&mdash;the
ring given me by old Mother Jensdochter, in
Iceland, and which, as you remember, I lost a few
days after we left Sermersoak, when lending a hand
to haul the main-tack on board the <i>Leda</i>."
</p>

<p>
"Your ring!" I exclaimed; "this is like a bit of
a fairy tale."
</p>

<p>
"My ring," he continued; "and here it is, hid
among my hair to conceal it from these greedy
negroes, who would at once deprive me of it, and
keep it as an ornament or amulet."
</p>

<p>
"This is most singular!"
</p>

<p>
"Singular indeed, but on beholding it a new glow
of hope filled my breast.  I resolved to persevere
in my efforts to escape, and so became too bold, for,
venturing upon the open beach next day, I was
seen by some savages belonging to the King of
Biafra, who pursued and soon made me their
prisoner.  The rest of my story is nearly the same
as your own, as my captors were with a caravan on
their way to Benin, to attend the funeral of King
Zabadie.
</p>

<p>
"I was severely treated by them.  Under a
burning and vertical sun, they employed me
constantly in loading and unloading their dromedaries,
or in pulling up esculent roots for them, and this
was a serious task even to a hard-handed sailor, as
these roots lay among thorny leaves and serrated
grass, the blades of which were like newly-sharpened
saws.
</p>

<p>
"In the desert, the sand was so hot that it baked
or roasted the eggs I stole or found at times, and
was fain to eat in secret.  When my work was
over, I was always malevolently treated by the
women, and more especially by those little black
imps, the children of the caravan.  Their chief
occupation was spitting at me, reviling and pelting
me with stones, bones, rotten gourds, and every
missile that came to hand.
</p>

<p>
"The women had a particular animosity to my
beard, and the men hereabouts, like other darkies,
not being troubled with much of that commodity,
joined them in the general desire for having it
uprooted, but I contrived to weather them by singeing
it off.
</p>

<p>
"Every way I endured great misery.  I was not
even permitted to drink of spring water, save from
a calabash, which some of their dogs had used; and
to tell the truth, I preferred to drink after the poor
doggies rather than after their beastly masters.
</p>

<p>
"Well, it would seem that His High Mightiness,
the King of Biafra, is a vassal of that more
illustrious nigger the King of Benin; so, five days ago,
I was sent here, with many other miserable wretches,
to be&mdash;to be&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"What?"
</p>

<p>
"Immolated on the grave of the late king, or
buried within it."
</p>

<p>
"Is such the custom?" I asked, with indescribable
dismay.
</p>

<p>
"Benin borders on the kingdom of Dahomey, and
all the world knows how the people there celebrate
the obsequies of their kings."
</p>

<p>
"How?"
</p>

<p>
"Frequently by the massacre of thousands."
</p>

<p>
"Hartly!  Hartly&mdash;we seem to go from bad to
worse!"
</p>

<p>
"I have been in the Pongo Isles, along the coast
of Guinea, and in the Bight of Benin before, and
know all about the fiendish ways of their inhabitants.
Jack, did you observe a great hole in the
courtyard without?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes; and I can hear the shovels of the workers
among the earth even now."
</p>

<p>
"When a king dies here, his body is laid in a
kind of great hall, which, like that at Dahomey, has
a ceiling ornamented by the jawbones of his enemies.
There the very sleeping chambers of royalty are
paved with human skulls, and have cornices entirely
composed of them!  Zabadie, the King of Benin, is
just dead, and his son proposes to inter him with
unusual splendour."
</p>

<p>
"In that hole?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes."
</p>

<p>
"But what is all this to us?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh," groaned Hartly, "do you not understand&mdash;have
I not told you?  When a king dies here, a
great grave is dug somewhere near the palace, and
it must be hollowed so deep, that the diggers are
drowned by the water which bursts in upon them,
and there they lie, after concluding their work.
In this great hole the fiadoors place the royal
corpse, dressed in all its barbaric finery, with a
lance, sword, bow and arrows.  With the dead king
are placed all his favourites and servants, who are
supposed to follow him to the other world, and
serve him there; and so proud are they of this
distinction, that it occasions the most violent disputes
as to who shall have the honour of entombment, so
blind and idolatrous is the veneration of these
creatures for their dingy monarchs.  When the last
man has descended into the hole, an immense stone
is placed over it; this is removed a few days after,
and one of the great fiadoors inquires what are the
tidings from beneath, adding,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"'Who has gone to serve the king?'
</p>

<p>
"Then the poor wretches who are expiring below
reply according to circumstances.
</p>

<p>
"Day after day the stone is removed, and the
same questions are asked, until all in that horrid
pit have 'gone to serve the king,' and are dead of
starvation and the noxious miasma of the vault.
When no voice responds to the inquiry of the
fiadoor, the great stone is securely built over, a
mighty fire is made upon it, a great festival is held,
and the flesh of an elephant is roasted and given to
the multitude."
</p>

<p>
"And we&mdash;we&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Are to be placed there among the slaves of the
dead Zabadie."
</p>

<p>
I remained silent, oppressed by the horror of
what was before us; but Hartly spoke again:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"When a year has passed and gone, these
wretches, in honour of their dead king and his
dead followers, make a dreadful sacrifice of men and
animals, till about five hundred are destroyed.  Most
of the human victims are malefactors, or slaves taken
in war.  If enough of either are not to be had, the
king sends his female guards into the streets at
night to decoy and seize men till the number is
made up."
</p>

<p>
This was a cheerful account of the state of society
in the realm of Benin, and it afforded ample food
for thrilling reflection and fruitless surmises.

<h3>
CHAPTER LIII.
<br /><br />
THE FEMALE GUARDS.
</h3>

<p>
Yams, bananas, plantains, even boiled potatoes, and
pipkins of pure spring water were liberally
provided for us by our black female guardians, six of
whom appeared once daily with our food and
then retired, securing us with great bars of wood
fastened outside in some fashion known only to
themselves.
</p>

<p>
These Amazons were all well armed, and some
were richly clad in braided vests and petticoats of
Dutch scarlet cloth.  Among them were several
veteran female warriors, whose skins, by the process
of time under a tropical sun, had become spotted
yellow and brown, like the hides of the leopard and
panther.
</p>

<p>
Light was admitted to our prison by a small
square hole cut through one of the trees which
formed the wall, and from thence, when each
supported the other on his shoulders, we could see by
turns the progress of the diggers of the royal grave
in the courtyard, and to judge by the quantity of
earth and stones thrown up, the depth must have
been immense; and it seemed as if King Zabadie
was going to the other world accompanied by all
his wives, slaves, dromedaries, and diabolical
courtiers to boot.
</p>

<p>
We knew not <i>when</i> this dreadful interment and
immolation were to take place.  When day dawned
on us, we knew not if we should be permitted to see
it close; when it closed, we knew not if we should
ever behold another dawn.
</p>

<p>
So the wretched hours passed slowly, wearily on;
and the close of the third day found us still
captives, and still unresolved on any expedient to
dree ourselves.
</p>

<p>
Sailor-like, Hartly was fertile in schemes and
resources; but the former were no sooner proposed
than they were abandoned as impracticable.
</p>

<p>
One time he suggested that we should endeavour
to procure a light by friction, set fire to the old
wooden den in which we were confined, and then
seek an escape amid the consequent confusion; at
another, he proposed that we should close with our
guards, wrest away a musket, kill one or two of
them, and fight our way off; but how could we
attack women?
</p>

<p>
"If once free of the palace, the town, and its
suburbs&mdash;&mdash;" resumed he.
</p>

<p>
"Free! how can we remain free, Hartly, in a
land where our colour, which there is <i>no</i> disguising,
renders us constantly liable to recognition, to attack,
and recapture?"
</p>

<p>
"True; but if we could only reach the coast, after
having so dearly learned circumspection, we might
lurk in the woods."
</p>

<p>
"Without arms?"
</p>

<p>
"We have done so before.  Then we might steal
a canoe, or fashion one, and put to sea."
</p>

<p>
"But the tools and the skins?"
</p>

<p>
"We could steal both, as these fellows won't
lend."
</p>

<p>
"Escape from this is necessary first: and in the
pilfering visits you suggest, we should certainly be
retaken, together or singly; and then how miserable
would be the reflections of the survivor."
</p>

<p>
"Tut, Jack! unless we venture we shall never
win."
</p>

<p>
"Ah, Hartly," said I, "at last I have lost all
hope!"
</p>

<p>
"Do not say so; we are both too young to
despair," was the sturdy response of the English
sailor.
</p>

<p>
We thought of the old stereotyped modes of
escape&mdash;by ropes or ladders manufactured from
shirts and trowsers, and by ample melodramatic
mantles; but such were impossible to us, who were
nearly as nude as when we came into the world; by
drugging our guards or sentinels; by bribing, coaxing,
or assassinating them; but these, and all the
thousand other modes by which heroic and romantic
gentlemen, when in trouble or durance, effect escapes in
novels and plays, were useless or impracticable there.
</p>

<p>
Hartly, indeed, proposed to make love to one or
two ladies of the royal guard, and by gaining their
confidence, to effect the appropriation of their
muskets and ammunition.  But those dingy Amazons
seemed of a very unapproachable nature; and
moreover, were so thickly smeared with war-paint
and vegetable oils, as to be too hideous in aspect
and repulsive in odour to render the attempt at
all pleasant.
</p>

<p>
So the darkness of the third night closed upon us,
and undecided as to any mode of escape, we sat
gazing with longing eyes on the little bit of blue
sky that was visible through the hole, which by day
afforded light and air into our den.
</p>

<p>
A single star of uncommon brilliance shone
through it now, and so brightly as to cast the
form of the loophole upon the floor like a little
white patch.
</p>

<p>
"If once we were out of this place," said
Hartly, for the twentieth time, "I would certainly
trust to my two hands and pair of heels for doing
the rest."
</p>

<p>
"The town walls seem a high palisade."
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  I had a good view of them for an hour
and more on the unlucky day I first arrived in
Benin.  And yet, Jack," he added, kindly, "I am
glad those devils brought me here, after all&mdash;we
should never have met again else.  The town
walls are a double palisade, sparred over on the
outside and in&mdash;double sheathed a sailor would call
it&mdash;and then the whole is plastered over with red
clay."
</p>

<p>
"Their height&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Is not less than twelve feet; and at those parts
of the town which are without a rampart, there is a
ditch of great depth, full of slime and poisonous
serpents, and bordered by an impassable hedge of
brambles, through which fire alone could make its
way."
</p>

<p>
If I attempted to sleep, I was haunted by visions
of being buried alive in that enormous tomb, from
which there could be no escape&mdash;buried amid a
hecatomb of hideous and sweltering negro corpses and
the dead royalty of a savage race.  The pictures my
imagination drew of the future nearly distracted
me; and I began to consider whether it was
not better, by rushing barehanded and unarmed
upon our captors, to provoke a more speedy and
merciful death under their knives, asseguys, or
muskets; and failing an escape, Hartly agreed with
me that it was a wiser alternative; but Heaven
lent us its helping hand ere the third night was
passed.

<h3>
CHAPTER LIV
<br /><br />
ATTEMPT TO ESCAPE AGAIN.
</h3>

<p>
On this night, for more than an hour, there was an
unusual beating of tum-tums, and the chorus of some
barbaric songs stole upon the wind at times from
that quarter of the royal dwelling in which the
wives of the late King Zabadie were enclosed.
</p>

<p>
During the past day the digging in the courtyard
had ceased; and this circumstance, together
with the sounds we heard (the adoration of some
great fetish, or idol), made us tremble in our
hearts lest the following day might see us placed in
that more horrible prison, from whence there could
be no release but by death.
</p>

<p>
We mutually expressed our fears of this; and so
absorbed were we in this terrible surmise, that some
time elapsed before we perceived that the blue of
the sky and the light of the stars had disappeared;
that a thick vapour had overspread both&mdash;that rain
was pattering heavily on the flat roofs of the wooden
city; and that thunder, the deep, hoarse thunder of
the tropics, which sounds as if it would rend the
earth in twain, was roaring athwart the darkened
firmament.
</p>

<p>
The rain now poured down in such mighty
torrents, that we listened to the din of its fall in
silent wonder; for it seemed as if once again that
"all the fountains of the great deep had broken up,
and the windows of heaven were opened."
</p>

<p>
Ere long we felt the drops descending upon us,
tepid and sulphureous, as the clay coating that
covered the split canes, or lathing, which, formed
the roof of our prison, soon became a puddle; while
the straw and leaves on which we usually sat or
reclined, were reduced to a mass of wetted mire.
</p>

<p>
For nearly an hour this continued, till our den
became so thoroughly wet, that when the rain was
over not a single dry spot could we find; and (as
Hartly said) King Zabadie's trench in the courtyard
would have the water some fathoms deep in it
by this time.
</p>

<p>
On the rain ceasing, and the clouds dispersing,
which they did as suddenly as the storm had come
on, we saw the stars shining through a breach
which the moisture had made in the roof, and
something like a branch that was waving to and fro fell
on my upturned face.
</p>

<p>
I grasped it.
</p>

<p>
It was the strong sinewy tendril of a climbing
convolvulus, which had fallen through the aperture.
I drew it down, so far as it would come, and then
<i>another</i> branch fell in.  On this I called joyously
to Hartly, that "here were the first means of
escape!"
</p>

<p>
Without a moment's hesitation he grasped them,
twisted them together, and with sailor-like agility
swung himself up, hand over hand, till he reached
the crevice through which they had fallen.
</p>

<p>
Supporting the whole weight of his body by the
left hand, with the right he tore down a mass of the
fragile roof, and swinging himself up, passed through
and at length stood upon the outside.
</p>

<p>
"Now, Jack," said he, "come up in the same
fashion, hand over hand&mdash;it is just like going
through the lubber's hole, instead of over the
futtock shrouds.  Bravo! we'll weather this dead
devil of a king and his armed wenches to boot."
</p>

<p>
I dragged myself up by the twisted tendrils, but
when near the hole should have fallen to the ground,
had not Hartly's strong and friendly hands grasped
and dragged me on to the roof, where for a little time
we lay flat on our faces, panting alike with exertion
and excitement, and listening anxiously to hear if
any guards or watchers were near us.
</p>

<p>
By the starlight we could see the long rows of
flat wooden huts which composed the palace divided
into various courts.  At the distance of three
hundred yards from us, on our right, a ruddy glow
that deepened into crimson, then wavered, sunk, and
flashed up again, revealed the outline of a monstrous
fetish, or wooden idol, of hideous aspect, which the
young King, his fiadoors, guards, and people were
worshipping; and we could see the woolly heads
bowed before it packed thick and close as cannon
balls in Woolwich arsenal.
</p>

<p>
The long vista of the great street of huts, which
stretches the entire length of the town, and is
alleged to be three miles long, lay upon our left.
</p>

<p>
We had no guide to the ramparts or outskirts;
but as the long extent of this street seemed empty
and silent, our best chance of ultimate escape
lay through it.
</p>

<p>
Again grasping the tendrils of the convolvulus,
we slid down from the roof and reached the ground.
Robert Hartly dropped first.  When I was following,
the tendrils gave way, and I fell heavily, making
thus a noise which roused a large dog in an adjacent
shed, where it barked furiously; but as we lay close
and still, it gradually ceased, and growled itself off
to sleep again.
</p>

<p>
We were in a garden attached to the King's
residence; and being (by our white skins) liable to
immediate pursuit, capture, or destruction, the
moment we were seen&mdash;a contingency that would
become a certainty when day broke&mdash;we hurried
through it, getting our legs and feet severely cut
and torn by the flowers and prickly plants; but of
this minor evil we had no heed at that time.
</p>

<p>
A paling of split canes was soon surmounted, and
once more we found ourselves in the long street of
Benin.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap55"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER LV
<br /><br />
THE FORMOSA.
</h3>

<p>
"If once we are free from the town," said Hartly,
"we can find concealment during the day, and by
travelling at night may reach the coast.  Then, if we
can but obtain a canoe, and pass over to one of the
little isles in the Bight, we might remain there
snugly enough, till some ship ran in on the same
unlucky errand which brought poor Baylis here."
</p>

<p>
"I pray it may end as you say."
</p>

<p>
"Courage, Jack!  Energy and faith will work
miracles!"
</p>

<p>
"But I imagine&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Don't talk of imagination; it may only paralyse
you by the fears it fashions, the danger it suggests;
but hush!"
</p>

<p>
At that moment the fire before the idol flared up
broad and redly, and then the mingled roar of many
voices swelled upon the night air.
</p>

<p>
High above the hedge-rows or kraals for containing
cattle, and the lines of countless huts, formed of
turf, of wickered cane, and other rude materials
which the wild vines, creepers, and convolvuli
concealed, rose the lurid flame that blazed before the
misshapen god of Benin; and far across the flat
city it cast the shadows of the tall giraffe trees,
which grew in rows around the palace wall.
</p>

<p>
This red light mingled with the pale white lustre
of the moon, which was just rising at the horizon,
from whence its splendour cast long and steady
shadows across the streets, and thereby favoured
alike our concealment and escape.
</p>

<p>
As we hurried along the empty thoroughfares
towards the town wall, Hartly found at the door of
a hut, a war-club, of which he immediately took
possession.  It was formed of teak-wood, black as
ebony, ponderously heavy, and its knob was covered
by elaborate carvings.
</p>

<p>
While our hearts alternately glowed with hope,
or sank with apprehension, unseen we reached the
high wall of wood and clay, and ran alongside it, in
search either of an outlet, or some means of
surmounting it; but no wild creepers, no gourd vines
or climbing convolvuli were permitted to grow there.
</p>

<p>
We had been out of our prison at least
half-an-hour without being met or seen by a single
negro.
</p>

<p>
At last we reached a place where, for more than
a hundred feet, the wall was breached by the recent
storm of wind and rain, which had overturned and
beaten its ruins flat on the ground.
</p>

<p>
With mutual exclamations of joy, we were proceeding
to clamber over the fallen piles of rotten
palisades and clay, when a wretched negro, who
appeared suddenly, on perceiving the whiteness of
our skins in the bright moonlight, uttered a loud
cry of wonder or alarm!
</p>

<p>
In an instant we heard the clatter of steel, and
at least a dozen of the King's armed women issued
from a kind of wooden tower which stood near the
fallen wall.
</p>

<p>
Hartly uttered something very like an oath; he
struck the negro to the earth by a blow of his club,
and crying&mdash;"Follow me, Jack!" sprang over the
scattered ruin, and rushed into the moonlit country
beyond.
</p>

<p>
Swift of foot and active as these "fair viragoes"
were, they proved no match for us in a race for life
or death, especially when encumbered ty their
muskets, asseguys, and red petticoats, which were
covered with heavy beads, lions' teeth, and grass
braiding.
</p>

<p>
Two shots were fired after us, but where the balls
went, Heaven only knows; fortunately, they fell far
from us.
</p>

<p>
On we ran in the full blaze of the moonlight,
bathed in perspiration, now floundering among wild
gourds and creeping plants, where little snakes
started up to hiss at us; anon over waste tracts,
where lilies and geraniums covered all the
wilderness; then among long and serrated grass, which
cut our shins like saws and sabre-blades.  Next we
tore a passage through dense masses of wild canes,
then through fields of maize, or rice, or millet, and
often through cattle kraals, till we reached a wood,
where, after taking the precaution of running in
<i>one</i> direction in the full light of the moon, we
turned and, hare-like, doubled in the <i>other</i>.
</p>

<p>
By this manoeuvre, I believe, we baffled our <i>fair</i>
pursuers, as we saw no more of them for the
remainder of that night or the following morning,
during the long hours of which we lay close to the
earth, buried and hidden under a cool and shady
mass of leaves and jungle.
</p>

<p>
And there, without water to quench our thirst,
and without other food than a few wild berries that
grew within arm's length of our lurking place, we
lay concealed during the whole of the next day.
</p>

<p>
When night fell, Hartly climbed into a chestnut-tree,
and after looking carefully around him, uttered
an exclamation of delight.
</p>

<p>
"I see the way we must steer, Jack," he added.
</p>

<p>
"You can see the ocean?"
</p>

<p>
"Ay, or a large river, rippling in the moonlight
to the horizon far away."
</p>

<p>
A sigh of joy escaped me.
</p>

<p>
"And so, Jack, if our company is necessary to
complete the happiness of King Zabadie in the next
world, I am sorry for him, as he is likely to take
his long voyage without us."
</p>

<p>
The chestnut was lofty, and from it Hartly could
see on one hand the distant hills which form the
termination of that mighty chain, the mountains of
Kong, and end at the river Formosa.  On the
other hand, beyond the flat and open country, he
could see the great river itself, flowing towards the
Bight of Benin, along whose shores and by whose
waters lay all our ultimate hope of escape.
</p>

<p>
We bathed ourselves in a limpid pool to freshen
and brace our nerves; I armed me with a cudgel
formed of a young tree torn up by the roots;
Hartly had still his war-club; and resolving to
travel only under cloud of night, as cautiously as
possible, and to avoid all negro camps and villages,
we found the highway&mdash;if it could be called
so&mdash;which leads from the city of Benin towards the
Waree.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap56"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER LVI.
<br /><br />
A PERILOUS JOURNEY.
</h3>

<p>
In our ignorance of the wild country through
which we travelled, our sole guide towards the sea
was the course of the river Formosa, which rapidly
widened into a mighty estuary, along the left bank
of which we proceeded with the utmost circumspection;
and inspired by the triple dread of being
recaptured and killed by the natives, devoured by wild
animals, or sinking under the heavy miasma which
exhales from the marshy creeks and isles of the
uncounted river-mouths which there pour their
muddy tides into the Bight of Benin, laden with
the decaying vegetable débris of an unexplored world.
</p>

<p>
By various sounds which the wind swept after us
at times, such as the baying of dogs, and notes of
cane horns, we feared a pursuit by the people of
Benin, and the sequel proved that our fears were
but <i>too</i> true.
</p>

<p>
We were frequently bewildered by seeing large
lakes, which we conceived to be the sea, till dawn of
day would reveal their size, and the gigantic trees
or walls of wavy reeds which surrounded their
stagnant waters.
</p>

<p>
Hartly often beguiled the way by relating strange
stories he had heard or read, and by the margin of
one of those silent lakes in the wilderness he told
me of the shattered hull of an ancient ship being
found, beached upon the bank of one of those inland
waters in the continent of Africa.
</p>

<p>
"How came it to be cast up there?" I asked,
with surprise.
</p>

<p>
"Some alleged that it came through a subterraneous
opening, a channel in the bowels of the earth,
connected with the same vortex or whirlpool which
had sucked it down long years ago&mdash;the Maelstrom,
perhaps, though many say that, like Charybdis, no
such place exists.  But it sounds very like a bouncing
yarn, such as one may hear at the Royal Society,
or under the leech of the foresail of a fine night,
Jack, when the middle watch are spinning their
<i>twisters</i>."
</p>

<p>
We spent a whole night wearily and anxiously
circumnavigating the banks of one of those lakes
whose waters were full of thick green slime, of
sturdy reeds, and leaves of wondrous size and form;
falling into black quagmires and deep holes made
by the clumsy hippopotami, and every instant in
danger of being pounced upon by a panther or a
poisonous snake for our intrusion upon their secluded domains.
</p>

<p>
It is in these lakes of Benin, and in those of the
kingdom of Angola, that the quaint old writer
named Dapper (who must have been a very fanciful
or credulous personage) relates he saw "water
animals which the negroes call <i>ambisiangula</i>, and
the Portuguese <i>pezze-moueller</i>.  These monsters
are both male and female.  They are eight feet
long and four broad, with short arms and long
fingers of three joints, like ours.  They have
an oval head and eyes, a high forehead, a flat
nose, and great mouth.  Snares are laid for them,
and when caught, they sigh and cry like women
till they are killed by darts.  Their entrails and
flesh are like those of hogs in scent, taste, and
form.  'Tis said the filings of certain skull-bones in
the males, if mixed with wine, are an excellent
remedy against gravel, and the bone which extends
towards the membrane of the ear is good against
bad vapour, if we may believe the Portuguese."
</p>

<p>
Master Dapper then goes on to state, that of the
ribs of this wonderful fish, particularly those on the
left side, surgeons can make a powder which will
effectually stanch bleeding, and that bracelets
made of them were worn for the preservation of
health.  Another account, published in 1714, adds,
that in the Cabinet of Rarities at Leyden one of
their <i>hands</i> is preserved, and two others were in the
<i>Musæum Regium</i> at Copenhagen.
</p>

<p>
We, however, never saw aught but the fibrous
leaves of enormous aquatic plants, large as
table-cloths, floating on the water of these lakes, under
the clear lustre of a lovely moon, that cast the
shadows of the feathery palm and bending orange-trees
from banks where the alligator dozed amid the
slime, or the hippopotamus came to crop the herbage
and bask in the rays of the sun when he rose above
the foliage of the vast untrodden forest.
</p>

<p>
Manfully we struggled on, supporting nature by
such fruits and esculents as we found, especially
yams, and on the sixth night after our escape, with
a prayer of thankfulness, we found ourselves under
the friendly shelter of a chestnut grove, and close
upon the shore of the mighty sea.
</p>

<p>
We were now so scorched and burned by the
sun, and so embrowned by daily and nightly exposure,
that we might very well have passed for a
couple of mulattoes, and so have claimed kindred
with our tormentors.
</p>

<p>
We had now left the territories of Benin, and
were in the land of Waree, which has a dingy
sovereign of its own.  The whole of this district is
covered by wild forests, which in the wet season
are frequently converted into lakes and marshes,
where the stems of the trees are submerged for two
or three feet in water.
</p>

<p>
Opposite to where we lay concealed, and at the
distance of a mile from us, we saw a little green
island, having upon its summit a negro village,
some of the inhabitants of which, when day broke,
came over to the mainland with four canoes, which
they moored or beached in a creek not three
hundred yards distant from where we lurked among
some long grass.
</p>

<p>
These negroes were sixteen in number, all armed
with asseguys, muskets, and bows, and they
proceeded into the forest apparently to hunt.
</p>

<p>
We climbed into a leafy chestnut for security,
and passed the entire day amid its branches, thus
escaping the hunting party, several of whom passed
underneath us, on their way back to the canoes in
which they embarked, and returned to the island
laden with game.
</p>

<p>
These canoes were large; each appeared to be a
single tree hollowed out, and flattened in the bottom.
Hartly, who announced his intention of borrowing
one <i>sans</i> leave on the first available opportunity,
said, that after being scooped out, straw was burned
in them to save the wood from being spoiled by
worms.  They can be rowed swiftly, and are steered
by a long spar, which acts as a rudder.  The oars are
usually made of teak-wood, and fashioned like spades.
</p>

<p>
Each of these canoes had a round knob on its
prow; and by this they were pulled ashore with
ease, and beached high and dry upon the thick
mangrove leaves of the creek.
</p>

<p>
When night fell again, I sank into a profound
sleep among the branches of our chestnut tree.
There was no danger of a tumble, we had become
so accustomed to roosting on such perches.
</p>

<p>
Day dawned again, and we looked about us.
</p>

<p>
Ah! what were our emotions <i>then</i> on seeing
in the blue waters of the bay, and about two miles
from the green island, <i>two vessels at anchor</i>&mdash;one
a brig, with American colours flying; and the
other a stately ship, with the broad scarlet ensign
of Britain floating at her gaff peak!
</p>

<p>
There they rode proudly at their moorings; but
we were destitute alike of means for reaching them
or making signals; as yet all their boats were on
board, and we could perceive no sign of any of them
being despatched ashore.  Their topsails and
topgallant sails were handed; but their courses were
only hauled up, and some of their fore and aft
canvas hung loose in the brails.
</p>

<p>
We gazed at them with tearful and haggard eyes,
our hearts swelling the while with mingled hope
and fear&mdash;hope that they might yet save, and fear
that they might unwittingly sail and abandon us.
</p>

<p>
While we were debating what was to be done, the
four canoes with the sixteen negroes again shot off
from the island village, and disappeared among the
mangroves of the creek; and soon after we saw
them, as on the previous day, pass, armed, into the
wood to hunt.
</p>

<p>
"Now is our opportunity, Jack&mdash;now or never!"
cried Hartly, as he dropped lightly from the tree;
"let us make a rush at the canoes, seize one and
shove off!"
</p>

<p>
I instantly followed his example; but, alas! we
were too rash in our desire to embark, for at the
same instant we dropped from our perches, we found
ourselves confronted by two of the savages, whom
the suddenness of our appearance seemed to fill
with astonishment and irresolution.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap57"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER LVII.
<br /><br />
PURSUIT AGAIN.
</h3>

<p>
Without pausing for a moment to express friendly
or other signs, we rushed down with headlong speed
towards the creek, where the canoes lay beached
upon the thick fringe of mangrove leaves, and eight
of the sixteen hunters pursued us; but notwithstanding
the swiftness of foot they possessed&mdash;a
swiftness acquired by a savage and roving life&mdash;we
distanced them with ease, for despair seemed to lend
us the strength and speed of ostriches as we rushed
towards the beach.
</p>

<p>
An asseguy, aimed with almost fatal precision,
glanced over my left shoulder, and shivered as it
sank into the turf beyond me.  Then a war-club,
thrown with fatal force and dexterity, struck poor
Hartly between the shoulders, and nearly prostrated
him; but in less than two minutes we were in the
creek, and had one of the largest canoes afloat.
</p>

<p>
"In, in, Jack&mdash;leap in!" cried Hartly, while he
lightly and adroitly pushed the other three into the
water, and setting them all afloat to cut off pursuit,
sprang in after me.
</p>

<p>
His presence of mind was most fortunate, for on
the steep brow of an eminence which overhung the
creek on the side opposite to our more immediate
pursuers, there suddenly burst a storm of shrill yells
and discordant shouts, mingled with the beating of
tum-tums and the snorting of ferocious dogs, as a
number of Benin savages, who doubtless had tracked
us thither with the most fell intentions, rushed to
the shore in pursuit&mdash;but thank Heaven, happily
too late!
</p>

<p>
Hartly's sinewy hand had shot two of the canoes
some thirty yards or so from the beach; and while
towing a third by its bow-knob, he proceeded to row
most vigorously with one of the spade-like paddles
which lay in our craft.
</p>

<p>
Ere we got out of the wooded creek its water
smoked and boiled under the shower of missiles&mdash;arrows,
asseguys, clubs, and stones&mdash;which were
sent after us, while five negroes and several dogs
plunged in to pursue or to slay.
</p>

<p>
These tracking dogs were animals of strange
aspect&mdash;sharp-nosed, with skins spotted black and
white, or red&mdash;they had slender legs, sharp tusks,
and a low, but ferocious bark.
</p>

<p>
While four of the negroes busied themselves in
bringing back the drifting canoes&mdash;an operation
during which one of them was shot by the musket of
some blundering comrade&mdash;the fifth, a man of fierce
and resolute bearing, having red and yellow circles
painted round his eyes, and a knife in his teeth,
swam after us, accompanied by a dog, the most
formidable of the whole.
</p>

<p>
Swiftly though our canoe shot through the water,
and vigorously though we paddled, they were soon
alongside of us.  The dog had his fore paws, and the
man his black hands, upon the gunnel at the same
moment.
</p>

<p>
The time was painfully critical!
</p>

<p>
I struck the dog with my paddle, and broke both
his fore legs; unable to swim, he floated away
sinking, yelping, and drowning; while Hartly
relinquishing the canoe he was towing, dealt the painted
savage&mdash;in whom I recognised Amoo, my former
master&mdash;a tremendous blow on the head.  Though
the latter proved <i>harder</i> than the hard wood paddle,
which was split and splintered, Amoo sank with a
yell of rage and pain.
</p>

<p>
After the danger was past, I was pleased to see
that he rose to the surface again and reached the
shore; for this negro chief was not, in some
respects, and apart from a general inclination to
homicide, ungenerous.
</p>

<p>
The three canoes were quickly crowded by armed
warriors, and rowed out of the creek at a speed that
bade fair soon to overhaul us, though we paddled
away, each on his own side, with all the rapidity
our strength and our desperation enabled as to
exert.
</p>

<p>
We were now entirely clear of the creek, and
about a quarter of a mile from the shore, when a
hearty English cheer rang across the water towards
us.
</p>

<p>
On turning and looking ahead, we saw two large
and well-manned boats, which had been put off from
the ship (the craft nearest the shore), pulled rapidly
towards us; while two rifles from the headmost one
were discharged into the canoes, as a hint for their
owners to sheer off, which they immediately did
with great expedition.
</p>

<p>
We were soon alongside of the nearest boat, the
crew of which pulled us on board, canoe and all,
continuing to cheer the while so lustily, that some time
elapsed before we could inform them that we were
countrymen.
</p>

<p>
The steersman then inquired whether there were
any more fugitives ashore.
</p>

<p>
We replied "No;" on which the boat's head was
turned towards the ship; the oars again fell into
the water, and the creek soon lessened and melted,
as it were, into the general scenery of the wooded
shore.
</p>

<p>
The vessel by which we were so providentially
rescued, proved to be the <i>Havelock</i>, of London, a fine
clipper ship of a thousand tons register, belonging, by
a singular coincidence, to my father&mdash;at least, to the
firm of Manly and Skrew, homeward bound from
the Cape; but which had been, like the barque of
poor Captain Baylis, driven out of her course by the
hurricane of the other night, and had anchored in
the Bight to procure fresh water, and repair some
trifling damages.
</p>

<p>
Soon her spars and hull (old England's wooden
wall), a welcome sight, rose higher from the water
as we pulled towards her; and as they rose, the low,
level, and marshy shore we had left, with all its
mangrove creeks and reedy lagunes&mdash;its wildernesses
of giant leaves, and long and fibrous creepers&mdash;its
dense jungles, where serpents hissed, monkeys
chattered, and crocodiles laid their eggs; where the
great yellow gourd and coarse serrated grass
flourished under the feathery palm and broad baobab
trees, amid slime and miasma, that carry death to
the vitals of the European&mdash;soon all these
diminished and sank astern, as our boat sped through
the shining sea; and, ere long, Robert Hartly and
I shook each other's hands with honest warmth and
joy, when we found ourselves among our own
countrymen, treading a deck of good English oak,
with the old scarlet bunting floating from the peak
halyards above us.
</p>

<p>
Three days the <i>Havelock</i> remained in the bay;
and during that time, you may be assured, neither
Hartly nor I had any wish to venture on shore.
</p>

<p>
I shall never forget the glow of happiness that
thrilled through me, when, on the third evening,
the Captain gave orders to hoist the boats on board
and prepare for sea.
</p>

<p>
"Man the windlass!" was the cry; "hands, up
anchor!"
</p>

<p>
The bars were inserted by sturdy hands in the
huge beam, and then the pauls clattered cheerily,
while the iron cable rattled as it was dragged aft
along the deck, and soon the great clipper ship came
round with her head to the wind.
</p>

<p>
"Cast loose the courses; away aloft&mdash;shake out
the topsails, and let fall!"
</p>

<p>
And anon the snowy canvas fell like white curtains
on the lower spars, as the topsail yards ascended
to the crosstrees.
</p>

<p>
"Heave on the cable&mdash;weigh!" was the next
order.
</p>

<p>
Tight as if its iron rings would snap like pack-thread
grew the mighty chain, for strong hands and
muscular arms were tugging with united strength
at the bars of bending ash.
</p>

<p>
"Together, lads&mdash;together&mdash;hurrah!" cried
Hartly, who had supplied himself with a handspike.
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Uptorn, reluctant, from its oozy cave,<br />
  The ponderous anchor rises o'er the wave."<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
And soon the great iron flukes were dripping with
glittering brine, as the ring rattled at the cathead;
then the yards were trimmed; the larboard tacks
were brought on board, and with a fine spanking
breeze, that came from the burning shores of Benin,
our fleet clipper ship bore away for Old England.
</p>

CONCLUSION.
</p>

<p>
Such were my adventures in the lands of snow
and sunshine&mdash;the latitudes of ice and fire!
</p>

<p>
On the 17th of December, exactly nine months
after the day on which Hartly and I had sailed
through the Narrows of St. John, we found ourselves
bowling along the crowded and busy streets of
London in a hackney cab, with our African canoe&mdash;all
the property we possessed&mdash;lashed on the roof
thereof.
</p>

<p>
We separated for a time at the Bank; he to look
after another ship, and I&mdash;like he of old, who came
to the husks and the swine trough&mdash;to return to my
father's house at Peckham (a tamer and wiser youth
than when I left it) and to the circle of my family,
who had long since gone into mourning for me.
</p>

<p>
I am delighted to add that my worthy Robert
Hartly soon got another vessel.  As sole survivors of
the crew of the <i>Leda</i>, we obtained, after a world of
trouble with the Red-tapists of the Circumlocution
Office, the 500<i>l.</i> offered by the Governor of
Newfoundland for the destruction of the <i>Black Schooner</i>.
</p>

<p>
My share I made over to Hartly, who invested it
in the capital of his new owner.
</p>

<p>
He still preserves, with religious care, the ring of
old Mother Jensdochter; and undeterred by all he
has undergone, sails from Blackwall for China on the
10th of next month.
